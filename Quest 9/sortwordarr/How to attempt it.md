Absolutely, Jasper ‚Äî let‚Äôs break this down from first principles so you understand *why* every part of this solution works. We‚Äôll go from the high-level goal to the low-level mechanics, and by the end, you‚Äôll be able to build this from scratch without memorizing anything.

## üß† The Big Picture: What Are We Solving?

You‚Äôre given a slice of strings: `[]string{"a", "A", "1", "b", "B", "2", "c", "C", "3"}`

Your goal is to **sort them in ascending ASCII order**.

### üî§ What is ASCII?

ASCII assigns a numeric value to every character:
- `'1'` = 49
- `'2'` = 50
- `'3'` = 51
- `'A'` = 65
- `'B'` = 66
- `'C'` = 67
- `'a'` = 97
- `'b'` = 98
- `'c'` = 99

So sorting by ASCII means sorting by these numeric values.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Solution

### 1. `SortWordArr(a []string)`

This is the main function. It takes a slice of strings and sorts it **in-place** (modifies the original slice).

```go
func SortWordArr(a []string) {
	for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
		for j := i + 1; j < len(a); j++ {
			if compare2Strings(a[i], a[j]) == 1 {
				temp := a[i]
				a[i] = a[j]
				a[j] = temp
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### üîç Why this loop structure?

This is a basic **selection sort**:
- Outer loop picks an element.
- Inner loop compares it with every element after it.
- If it finds something smaller, it swaps.

We use `compare2Strings` to decide which string is "greater" in ASCII terms.

---

### 2. `compare2Strings(s1, s2 string) int`

This function compares two strings character by character using their ASCII values.

```go
func compare2Strings(s1, s2 string) int {
	s1Arr := StrToRuneArr(s1)
	s2Arr := StrToRuneArr(s2)
```

### üß© Why convert to rune slices?

In Go, strings are UTF-8 encoded. A `rune` is an alias for `int32` and represents a Unicode code point. Converting to `[]rune` lets us safely compare characters by their numeric values.

```go
	minlen := 0
	if len(s1Arr) < len(s2Arr) {
		minlen = len(s1Arr)
	} else {
		minlen = len(s2Arr)
	}
```

We only compare up to the length of the shorter string to avoid index out-of-range errors.

```go
	for i := 0; i < minlen; i++ {
		if s1Arr[i] > s2Arr[i] {
			return 1
		}
		if s1Arr[i] < s2Arr[i] {
			return -1
		}
	}
```

### üîç Why this comparison?

This is **lexicographical comparison**:
- Compare first character of each string.
- If equal, move to next.
- If one is greater, return `1` (means s1 > s2).
- If one is smaller, return `-1`.

```go
	if len(s1Arr) > len(s2Arr) {
		return 1
	} else if len(s1Arr) < len(s2Arr) {
		return -1
	} else {
		return 0
	}
```

If all characters are equal, the shorter string is considered smaller.

---

### 3. `StrToRuneArr(s string) []rune`

This helper converts a string to a slice of runes.

```go
func StrToRuneArr(s string) []rune {
	var mRune []rune
	if len(s) > 0 {
		for _, v := range s {
			mRune = append(mRune, v)
		}
	}
	return mRune
}
```

### üß† Why not just use `[]rune(s)`?

You could! This function manually builds the rune slice, but `[]rune(s)` is a shortcut that does the same thing. This version is just more explicit for learning purposes.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Output

After sorting, the slice becomes:

```go
[1 2 3 A B C a b c]
```

Which matches the ASCII order perfectly.

## üß† Summary of Concepts You Learned

| Concept | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| ASCII values | Sorting is based on numeric character codes |
| Rune conversion | Ensures accurate character comparison |
| Lexicographical comparison | Mimics dictionary-style ordering |
| Selection sort | Simple sorting algorithm for small slices |
| In-place modification | Efficient memory usage |
