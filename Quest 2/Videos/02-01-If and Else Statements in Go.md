Absolutely stellar, Jasper — and now let’s make this masterclass even more piscine-relevant by incorporating the unique constraint of using only the github.com/01-edu/z01 package during your checkpoints. This restriction transforms even basic logic into a deeper test of your understanding and creativity.

# 🧠 Masterclass: Conditional Logic in Go — `if`, `else`, and `else if` (Piscine Edition)

## 🧩 Part 1: Overview — Why Conditionals Matter

| Construct   | Purpose                             | Behavior |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|----------|
| `if`        | Executes code when condition is true | First match wins |
| `else if`   | Adds additional conditional branches | Evaluated in order |
| `else`      | Catches all unmatched cases          | Default fallback |

Conditional statements are the control valves of your program — they determine which path your logic flows down based on truth values. But in the 01-edu piscine, the challenge isn’t just writing logic — it’s expressing output using only `z01.PrintRune`.

## 🧩 Part 2: Basic `if` Statement (Piscine Style)

### 🧪 Example
```go
import "github.com/01-edu/z01"

func main() {
	height := 185

	if height >= 180 {
		for _, r := range "In most countries, you are tall." {
			z01.PrintRune(r)
		}
		z01.PrintRune('\n')
	}
}
```

### ⚠️ Complexity
- You can’t use `fmt.Println` or `fmt.Sprintf`
- You must manually loop through each character in your message
- Even printing a newline requires `z01.PrintRune('\n')`

---

## 🧩 Part 3: Adding `else` — Handling the Other Side

### 🧪 Example
```go
if height >= 180 {
	for _, r := range "In most countries, you are tall." {
		z01.PrintRune(r)
	}
} else {
	for _, r := range "You are of average height." {
		z01.PrintRune(r)
	}
}
z01.PrintRune('\n')
```

### 🧠 Pro Tips
- Keep your messages short and clear — every character must be printed manually
- Use consistent formatting to avoid logic errors

---

## 🧩 Part 4: Introducing `else if` — Multiple Branches

### 🧪 Example
```go
if height >= 180 && height < 200 {
	for _, r := range "In most countries, you are tall." {
		z01.PrintRune(r)
	}
} else if height >= 200 {
	for _, r := range "You are very very tall." {
		z01.PrintRune(r)
	}
} else {
	for _, r := range "You are of average height." {
		z01.PrintRune(r)
	}
}
z01.PrintRune('\n')
```

### 🧠 Key Lesson
- You must write each branch carefully — no shortcuts
- Every output must be constructed character by character

## 🧩 Part 5: Common Pitfalls in Piscine Checkpoints

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Using `fmt` or `strings` | Not allowed in piscine | Use only `z01.PrintRune` |
| Passing a string to `PrintRune` | Invalid — expects a rune | Loop through each character |
| Forgetting newline | Output looks broken | Always end with `z01.PrintRune('\n')` |

---

## 🧩 Part 6: Mini Exercises (Piscine-Ready)

### 🧪 Exercise 1: Age-based classification
```go
age := 16

if age >= 18 {
	for _, r := range "You are an adult." {
		z01.PrintRune(r)
	}
} else {
	for _, r := range "You are a minor." {
		z01.PrintRune(r)
	}
}
z01.PrintRune('\n')
```

### 🧪 Exercise 2: Score grading
```go
score := 85

if score >= 90 {
	for _, r := range "Grade: A" {
		z01.PrintRune(r)
	}
} else if score >= 80 {
	for _, r := range "Grade: B" {
		z01.PrintRune(r)
	}
} else {
	for _, r := range "Grade: C or below" {
		z01.PrintRune(r)
	}
}
z01.PrintRune('\n')
```

---

## 🧩 Part 7: Advanced Notes for Piscine Survivors

- You must build your own formatting logic — even converting numbers to characters requires rune math:
  ```go
  z01.PrintRune(rune(score/10 + '0')) // crude way to print digits
  ```
- You can’t use `strconv.Itoa` — build your own number-to-string converter
- You’ll learn to appreciate every character you print — because you’ll write them all manually

## 🧩 Summary Table

| Condition        | Height Range | Output (via `z01.PrintRune`) |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| `height >= 180 && height < 200` | 180–199      | “In most countries, you are tall.” |
| `height >= 200`  | 200+         | “You are very very tall.”     |
| `else`           | <180         | “You are of average height.”  |

This is how we build mastery, Jasper — not just by writing conditionals, but by expressing logic under constraint. When you can build readable, reliable, and robust programs using only `z01.PrintRune`, you’re not just passing the piscine — you’re proving you can engineer under pressure.
