Let’s break this down so you understand *why* every part of the `PrintComb2()` function works — not just what it does. This will help you build similar logic from scratch and adapt it to more complex problems.

---

## 🎯 Goal Recap

Write a function:
```go
func PrintComb2()
```
That prints all **unique combinations** of two **different two-digit numbers** (from `00` to `99`) such that:
- The first number is **less than** the second
- Combinations are printed in **ascending order**
- Each combination is printed as `ab cd`
- Combinations are separated by `, ` — except the last one
- Output is on a **single line**, ending with a newline

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Theory

### 1. **Using Runes for Digits**
```go
for a := '0'; a <= '9'; a++
```

- `'0'` to `'9'` are rune literals (characters), not integers.
- Using runes directly allows you to print them with `z01.PrintRune()` without converting from int to rune.

> ✅ This simplifies printing and keeps the code readable.

---

### 2. **Nested Loops for Two-Digit Numbers**
```go
for a := '0'; a <= '9'; a++ {
	for b := '0'; b <= '9'; b++ {
		for c := '0'; c <= '9'; c++ {
			for d := '0'; d <= '9'; d++ {
				// Print combination
			}
		}
	}
}
```

- `a` and `b` form the first number: `ab`
- `c` and `d` form the second number: `cd`
- This covers all combinations from `00 01` to `98 99`

---

### 3. **Filtering Valid Combinations**
```go
if (a == c && b >= d) || a > c {
	continue
}
```

This ensures:
- The first number (`ab`) is **less than** the second (`cd`)
- If `a == c`, then `b < d`
- If `a > c`, skip — because `ab > cd`

> ✅ This avoids duplicates and invalid combinations like `01 00`, `99 99`, or `00 00`.

---

### 4. **Printing the Combination**
```go
z01.PrintRune(a)
z01.PrintRune(b)
z01.PrintRune(' ')
z01.PrintRune(c)
z01.PrintRune(d)
```

- Prints the two-digit numbers with a space between them
- Since they’re runes, no conversion is needed

---

### 5. **Handling the Separator**
```go
if a != '9' || b != '8' || c != '9' || d != '9' {
	z01.PrintRune(',')
	z01.PrintRune(' ')
}
```

- The last valid combination is `98 99`
- This condition ensures that `, ` is printed **only** if it’s not the last combination

> ✅ Prevents trailing comma after the final output.

---

### 6. **Ending the Output**
```go
z01.PrintRune('\n')
```

- Prints a newline after all combinations
- Ensures the shell prompt appears on a new line

---

## ✅ Final Function Recap

```go
package piscine

import "github.com/01-edu/z01"

func PrintComb2() {
	for a := '0'; a <= '9'; a++ {
		for b := '0'; b <= '9'; b++ {
			for c := '0'; c <= '9'; c++ {
				for d := '0'; d <= '9'; d++ {
					if (a == c && b >= d) || a > c {
						continue
					}
					z01.PrintRune(a)
					z01.PrintRune(b)
					z01.PrintRune(' ')
					z01.PrintRune(c)
					z01.PrintRune(d)
					if a != '9' || b != '8' || c != '9' || d != '9' {
						z01.PrintRune(',')
						z01.PrintRune(' ')
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
	z01.PrintRune('\n')
}
```

## 🛠️ Summary of Key Concepts

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `'0'` to `'9'` | Rune literals for digits |
| `ab < cd` | Ensures combinations are ordered |
| `z01.PrintRune()` | Prints single characters |
| `if a != '9' || b != '8' || c != '9' || d != '9'` | Skips separator after last combo |
| `\n` | Ends output with newline |
