Let’s break this down and understand every part of the solution — not just what it does, but *why* it works. This way, you’ll be able to build it from scratch and apply the same logic to similar problems.

## 🎯 Goal Recap

Write a Go program that prints:
```
0123456789
```
— all decimal digits in ascending order, followed by a newline.

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Theory

### 1. **Package Declaration**
```go
package main
```

- Every Go program starts with a package declaration.
- `main` means this is an executable program, not a library.

> ✅ Required for any standalone Go program.

---

### 2. **Importing the `z01` Package**
```go
import "github.com/01-edu/z01"
```

- This package provides a function: `z01.PrintRune(rune)`
- It prints a single character (rune) to standard output.

> ✅ You use this instead of `fmt.Print()` to match the exercise’s constraints.

---

### 3. **Main Function**
```go
func main() {
	...
}
```

- This is the entry point of your program.
- Go will execute everything inside `main()` when you run the program.

---

### 4. **Looping Through ASCII Values**
```go
for i := '0'; i <= '9'; i++ {
	z01.PrintRune(rune(i))
}
```

Let’s unpack this:
- `'0'` to `'9'` are rune literals representing ASCII values 48 to 57
- The loop runs from `'0'` to `'9'` (inclusive)
- `z01.PrintRune(rune(i))` prints each character

> ✅ This prints each digit from `'0'` to `'9'` in order.

---

### 5. **Printing a Newline**
```go
z01.PrintRune('\n')
```

- After printing all digits, you print a newline character
- This ensures the output ends cleanly on a new line

> ✅ Without this, the shell prompt would appear on the same line as the output.

---

## ✅ Final Program

```go
package main

import "github.com/01-edu/z01"

func main() {
	for i := '0'; i <= '9'; i++ {
		z01.PrintRune(rune(i))
	}
	z01.PrintRune('\n')
}
```

## 🛠️ Summary of Key Concepts

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `package main` | Declares an executable program |
| `import "github.com/01-edu/z01"` | Brings in the `PrintRune` function |
| `for i := '0'; i <= '9'; i++` | Loops through ASCII values for `'0'` to `'9'` |
| `z01.PrintRune(rune(i))` | Prints each digit |
| `z01.PrintRune('\n')` | Ends output with a newline |
