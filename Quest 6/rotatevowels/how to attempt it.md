Absolutely! Let‚Äôs break down the logic behind the `rotatevowels` program and build it up step by step so you understand **why** each part works‚Äînot just how. By the end, you‚Äôll be able to reconstruct it from scratch and even enhance it.

---

## üß† Goal of the Program

We want to write a Go program that:

- Accepts command-line arguments
- Finds all **vowels** in the input (a, e, i, o, u ‚Äî case-sensitive)
- **Mirrors** their positions: the first vowel becomes the last, the second becomes the second-to-last, etc.
- Leaves all other characters untouched
- If no arguments are passed, prints a newline
- If no vowels are found, prints the input unchanged

---

## ‚úÖ Final Code (with explanation)

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
	"github.com/01-edu/z01"
)

func main() {
	if len(os.Args) < 2 {
		printEndLine()
		return
	}

	// Collect all characters into one slice
	var input []rune
	for i := 1; i < len(os.Args); i++ {
		if i > 1 {
			input = append(input, ' ')
		}
		for _, r := range os.Args[i] {
			input = append(input, r)
		}
	}

	// Find vowel positions and values
	vowels := "aeiouAEIOU"
	var vowelIndices []int
	var vowelValues []rune

	for i, r := range input {
		if isVowel(r, vowels) {
			vowelIndices = append(vowelIndices, i)
			vowelValues = append(vowelValues, r)
		}
	}

	// Mirror the vowels
	for i, idx := range vowelIndices {
		input[idx] = vowelValues[len(vowelValues)-1-i]
	}

	// Print the result
	printString(string(input))
	printEndLine()
}
```

## üîç Step-by-Step Theory

### 1. `if len(os.Args) < 2`

- Checks if there are any arguments.
- `os.Args[0]` is the program name, so we need at least one more.

---

### 2. `input := []rune{}`

- We build a single slice of runes from all arguments.
- This lets us treat the input as one continuous string.

---

### 3. `if i > 1 { input = append(input, ' ') }`

- Adds a space between arguments, just like how they appear in the terminal.

---

### 4. `for _, r := range os.Args[i]`

- Loops through each character in each argument.
- Converts them to runes to handle Unicode safely.

---

### 5. `isVowel(r, vowels)`

```go
func isVowel(r rune, vowels string) bool {
	for _, v := range vowels {
		if r == v {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}
```

- Checks if a character is a vowel.
- Case-sensitive: matches both lowercase and uppercase vowels.

---

### 6. `vowelIndices` and `vowelValues`

- Stores the **positions** and **values** of all vowels found.
- We‚Äôll use these to reverse their positions later.

---

### 7. `for i, idx := range vowelIndices`

- Loops through the vowel positions.
- Replaces each vowel with its mirrored counterpart from the end of the list.

---

### 8. `printString(string(input))`

- Converts the rune slice back to a string and prints it character by character.

---

### 9. `printEndLine()`

- Prints a newline at the end.

## üß™ Example Execution

```bash
$ go run . "Hello World"
Hollo Werld

$ go run . "aEi" "Ou"
uOi Ea

$ go run . "str" "shh"
str shh
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `os.Args` | Accesses command-line arguments |
| `[]rune` | Handles Unicode safely |
| Vowel detection | Identifies characters to mirror |
| Index tracking | Enables position-based replacement |
| Mirroring logic | Reverses vowel positions |
| `z01.PrintRune` | Prints each character individually |
