Absolutely! Let‚Äôs break down this `revparams` program line by line and uncover the **why** behind every part. By the end, you‚Äôll understand how it works from the inside out‚Äîand be able to rebuild or adapt it confidently.

## üß† Goal of the Program

We want to write a Go program that:

- Accepts command-line arguments
- Prints each argument on a **new line**
- Prints them in **reverse order**
- Uses `z01.PrintRune` to print characters one by one (as required in 01-edu projects)

---

## ‚úÖ Full Code

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
	"github.com/01-edu/z01"
)

func main() {
	a := os.Args

	for i := len(a) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
		if i != 0 {
			for j := range a[i] {
				runes := []rune(a[i])
				{
					z01.PrintRune(runes[j])
				}
			}
			z01.PrintRune('\n')
		}
	}
}
```

## üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `package main`

- Every Go program starts with `package main` when it‚Äôs meant to be an executable.
- This tells the compiler: ‚ÄúThis is the entry point.‚Äù

---

### 2. `import ( "os" "github.com/01-edu/z01" )`

- `os`: Gives access to `os.Args`, which holds command-line arguments.
- `z01`: A special package used in 01-edu projects to print characters using `z01.PrintRune`.

---

### 3. `a := os.Args`

- `os.Args` is a slice of strings:
  - `os.Args[0]` is the program name (e.g., `./revparams`)
  - `os.Args[1:]` are the actual user-provided arguments
- We store it in `a` for convenience.

---

### 4. `for i := len(a) - 1; i >= 0; i--`

- Loops **backward** through the slice `a`.
- Starts from the last index and moves toward `0`.

---

### 5. `if i != 0`

- Skips the first element (`os.Args[0]`), which is just the program name.
- We only want to print the actual arguments.

---

### 6. `runes := []rune(a[i])`

- Converts the string to a slice of **runes**.
- Why runes?
  - Go strings are byte slices, but characters (especially Unicode ones) can be multiple bytes.
  - A **rune** is a Unicode code point, represented as `int32`.
  - This ensures we correctly handle all characters, even non-ASCII ones.

---

### 7. `for j := range a[i]`

- Loops through each character index of the argument string at position `i`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor inefficiency: `runes := []rune(a[i])` is inside the loop, so it gets re-created for every character. It would be better to move it outside the inner loop:
```go
runes := []rune(a[i])
for j := range runes {
	z01.PrintRune(runes[j])
}
```

Or even more idiomatically:
```go
for _, r := range []rune(a[i]) {
	z01.PrintRune(r)
}
```

---

### 8. `z01.PrintRune(runes[j])`

- Prints each character one by one using `z01.PrintRune`.

---

### 9. `z01.PrintRune('\n')`

- After printing each argument, we print a newline to move to the next line.

---

## üß™ Example Execution

```bash
$ go run . choumi is the best cat
cat
best
the
is
choumi
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `os.Args` | Accesses command-line arguments |
| `range` over slice | Iterates through arguments |
| `[]rune(s)` | Handles Unicode characters safely |
| `z01.PrintRune` | Prints each character individually |
| `'\n'` | Adds a line break after each word |
| Reverse loop | Prints arguments in reverse order |

---

Want to explore how to reverse the characters inside each word too, or how to sort arguments alphabetically before reversing? I‚Äôd love to walk you through that next.
