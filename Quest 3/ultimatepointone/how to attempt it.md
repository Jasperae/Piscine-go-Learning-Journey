Absolutely! This is a great exercise in understanding **deep pointer dereferencing** in Go. Let’s break it down step by step so you understand **why** this works and how to build it from scratch. By the end, you’ll be confident working with multiple levels of pointers.

## 🧠 Goal of the Function

We want to write a function called `UltimatePointOne` that:

- Takes a **pointer to a pointer to a pointer to an int** (`***int`)
- Sets the actual `int` value (deeply nested) to `1`

### Example Setup

```go
a := 0      // plain int
b := &a     // pointer to a
n := &b     // pointer to b
UltimatePointOne(&n) // pass pointer to n (which is ***int)
```

After calling `UltimatePointOne(&n)`, the value of `a` should become `1`.

---

## ✅ Full Code

```go
func UltimatePointOne(n ***int) {
	***n = 1
}
```

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `func UltimatePointOne(n ***int) {`

- This defines a function named `UltimatePointOne`.
- It takes one parameter: `n`, which is a **pointer to a pointer to a pointer to an int**.
- That means:
  - `*n` is a pointer to a pointer to an int (`**int`)
  - `**n` is a pointer to an int (`*int`)
  - `***n` is the actual int value

---

### 2. `***n = 1`

- This line **dereferences** the pointer three times to reach the actual `int` value.
- Then it assigns `1` to that value.

### Let’s visualize it:

```go
a := 0      // int
b := &a     // *int
n := &b     // **int
p := &n     // ***int
```

So:
- `*p` → `n` → `**int`
- `**p` → `b` → `*int`
- `***p` → `a` → `int`

Thus, `***p = 1` sets `a = 1`.

---

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

```go
a := 0
b := &a
n := &b
UltimatePointOne(&n)
fmt.Println(a) // Output: 1
```

### Memory before:
```
a → 0
b → &a
n → &b
```

### Inside function:
- `***n = 1` → sets `a = 1`

### Memory after:
```
a → 1
```

## 🧠 Why Use Triple Pointers?

This is mostly a **learning exercise** to understand how pointers work in layers. In real-world Go code, triple pointers are rare, but understanding them helps you:

- Work with complex data structures
- Pass references deeply through functions
- Understand memory and indirection

---

## ✅ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `*int` | Pointer to an integer |
| `**int` | Pointer to a pointer to an integer |
| `***int` | Pointer to a pointer to a pointer to an integer |
| `***n = 1` | Dereference three times to reach and modify the actual int value |
