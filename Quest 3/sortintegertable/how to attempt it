Absolutely! Let's break this down so you understand **every single part** of the solution—not just how it works, but **why** it works. By the end, you’ll be able to write your own sorting algorithm from scratch and even improve it.

## 🧠 Goal of the Function

We want to **sort a slice of integers in ascending order**, meaning from smallest to largest.

Given:
```go
[]int{5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0}
```

We want:
```go
[]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

## ✅ Full Code

```go
package piscine

func SortIntegerTable(t []int) {
	for i := 0; i < len(t); i++ {
		for j := 0; j < len(t); j++ {
			if t[i] < t[j] {
				a := t[j]
				t[j] = t[i]
				t[i] = a
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `package piscine`

- This declares the package name.
- It allows this function to be used in other files that import `piscine`.

---

### 2. `func SortIntegerTable(t []int)`

- This defines a function named `SortIntegerTable`.
- It takes a **slice of integers** `t` as input.
- The function modifies the slice **in place** (no return value needed).

---

### 3. `for i := 0; i < len(t); i++ {`

- This is the **outer loop**.
- It goes through each element in the slice.
- `i` represents the current index we're comparing **from**.

---

### 4. `for j := 0; j < len(t); j++ {`

- This is the **inner loop**.
- It compares the element at index `i` with every other element at index `j`.

---

### 5. `if t[i] < t[j] {`

- This is the **key comparison**.
- If the element at `i` is **less than** the element at `j`, we **swap** them.
- Why? Because we want the **smaller numbers to move toward the beginning** of the slice.

---

### 6. Swapping the values

```go
a := t[j]
t[j] = t[i]
t[i] = a
```

- This is a **classic swap** using a temporary variable `a`.
- We store `t[j]` in `a`, then assign `t[i]` to `t[j]`, and finally assign `a` (original `t[j]`) to `t[i]`.
- This ensures the values are exchanged without losing any data.

---

## 🔁 What Sorting Algorithm Is This?

This is a **variation of bubble sort**, but not the most efficient version.

- It compares **every pair** of elements.
- It swaps them if they’re out of order.
- Time complexity: **O(n²)** — not great for large slices, but fine for small ones.

---

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

Let's say `t = [5, 4, 3]`.

### First outer loop (`i = 0`):
- Compare `t[0] = 5` with `t[0] = 5` → no swap
- Compare `t[0] = 5` with `t[1] = 4` → swap → `t = [4, 5, 3]`
- Compare `t[0] = 4` with `t[2] = 3` → swap → `t = [3, 5, 4]`

### Second outer loop (`i = 1`):
- Compare `t[1] = 5` with `t[0] = 3` → no swap
- Compare `t[1] = 5` with `t[1] = 5` → no swap
- Compare `t[1] = 5` with `t[2] = 4` → swap → `t = [3, 4, 5]`

Now the slice is sorted!

## 🧼 Cleaner Version (Optional)

Here’s a more efficient and idiomatic version using **bubble sort**:

```go
func SortIntegerTable(t []int) {
	n := len(t)
	for i := 0; i < n-1; i++ {
		for j := 0; j < n-i-1; j++ {
			if t[j] > t[j+1] {
				t[j], t[j+1] = t[j+1], t[j]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Why is this better?

- It avoids unnecessary comparisons.
- It uses Go’s multiple assignment syntax to swap values cleanly.
- It’s still O(n²), but faster in practice.

## ✅ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `for i` and `for j` | Loop through all pairs of elements |
| `if t[i] < t[j]` | Check if elements are out of order |
| `swap` | Exchange values to move smaller ones forward |
| `[]int` | Slice of integers, passed by reference (in-place sorting) |

Would you like to try rewriting this using a different sorting algorithm like **selection sort** or **insertion sort**? Or maybe explore how to sort in **descending** order instead?
