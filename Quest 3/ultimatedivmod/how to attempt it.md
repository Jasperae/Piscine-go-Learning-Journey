Absolutely! Let's break this down step by step so you understand **exactly why** this works and how to build it from scratch. By the end, you'll be able to write pointer-based functions confidently and even optimize them.

## üß† Goal of the Function

We want to write a function called `UltimateDivMod` that:

- Takes two pointers to integers: `a` and `b`.
- Divides the value pointed to by `a` by the value pointed to by `b`.
- Stores the **quotient** in the location pointed to by `a`.
- Stores the **remainder** in the location pointed to by `b`.

### Example

```go
a := 13
b := 2
UltimateDivMod(&a, &b)
fmt.Println(a) // 6
fmt.Println(b) // 1
```

---

## ‚úÖ Full Code

```go
func UltimateDivMod(a *int, b *int) {
	var c int
	var d int
	c = *a / *b
	d = *a % *b
	*a = c
	*b = d
}
```

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `func UltimateDivMod(a *int, b *int) {`

- This defines a function named `UltimateDivMod`.
- It takes two parameters: `a` and `b`, both of type `*int` (pointer to an integer).
- Using pointers allows us to **modify the original variables** directly.

---

### 2. `var c int` and `var d int`

- We declare two temporary variables:
  - `c` will hold the **quotient** of the division.
  - `d` will hold the **remainder**.

### Why use temporary variables?

- To avoid overwriting the original values before both operations are complete.
- If we updated `*a` first, we‚Äôd lose the original value needed to compute the remainder.

---

### 3. `c = *a / *b`

- `*a` means: "get the value stored at the memory address `a` points to."
- `*b` means: "get the value stored at the memory address `b` points to."
- We divide `*a` by `*b` and store the result in `c`.

### Example:
```go
*a = 13
*b = 2
c = 13 / 2 = 6
```

---

### 4. `d = *a % *b`

- `%` is the **modulus operator**, which gives the remainder of the division.
- We calculate `13 % 2 = 1` and store it in `d`.

---

### 5. `*a = c`

- We update the value at the memory location pointed to by `a` with the quotient `c`.

---

### 6. `*b = d`

- We update the value at the memory location pointed to by `b` with the remainder `d`.

---

## üß™ Visual Example

Let‚Äôs walk through the memory:

```go
a := 13
b := 2
UltimateDivMod(&a, &b)
```

Before:
```
a ‚Üí 13
b ‚Üí 2
```

Inside function:
- `c = 13 / 2 = 6`
- `d = 13 % 2 = 1`
- `*a = 6`
- `*b = 1`

After:
```
a ‚Üí 6
b ‚Üí 1
```

---

## üßº Cleaner Version (Optional)

You can skip the temporary variables if you‚Äôre careful with the order:

```go
func UltimateDivMod(a *int, b *int) {
	*a, *b = *a / *b, *a % *b
}
```

### Why is this safe?

- Go evaluates the right-hand side **before** assigning to the left-hand side.
- So `*a / *b` and `*a % *b` are both computed using the original values before any assignment happens.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `*int` | Pointer to an integer |
| `*a`, `*b` | Dereference to access the actual values |
| `/` | Division operator (quotient) |
| `%` | Modulus operator (remainder) |
| Temporary variables | Prevent overwriting before both operations are done |
| `*a = c`, `*b = d` | Update original variables via pointers |
