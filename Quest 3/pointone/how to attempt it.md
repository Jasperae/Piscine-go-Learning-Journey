Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs turn this tiny function into a full understanding of how pointers work in Go. By the end, you‚Äôll know *exactly why* this works and how to build similar logic from scratch.

---

## üéØ Objective Recap

You‚Äôre writing a function:
```go
func PointOne(n *int)
```
That:
- Takes a pointer to an `int`
- Sets the value of that `int` to `1`

---

## üß† Step-by-Step Theory

### 1. **What Is a Pointer in Go?**

A pointer is a variable that stores the **memory address** of another variable.

- If `n := 0`, then `&n` is the pointer to `n` ‚Äî it holds the address of `n`
- If `p := &n`, then `*p` accesses the value stored at that address

> ‚úÖ So `*p = 1` means: ‚Äúgo to the memory location `p` points to, and store the value `1` there.‚Äù

---

### 2. **Function Signature**
```go
func PointOne(n *int)
```

- `n *int` means the function expects a pointer to an integer
- This allows the function to directly modify the original variable passed in

> ‚úÖ This is how Go functions can ‚Äúreach back‚Äù and change values outside their own scope.

---

### 3. **Setting the Value**
```go
*n = 1
```

- This line **dereferences** the pointer and sets the value at that memory address to `1`
- If you passed in the address of a variable (e.g. `&n`), this will change the original variable

> ‚úÖ This is the core of pointer manipulation: dereferencing and assignment.

---

### 4. **Why This Works in `main()`**
```go
n := 0
piscine.PointOne(&n)
fmt.Println(n)
```

- `n := 0` creates an integer with value `0`
- `&n` passes the **address** of `n` to `PointOne`
- Inside `PointOne`, `*n = 1` updates the value at that address
- So when you print `n`, it now holds `1`

> ‚úÖ This shows how pointers allow functions to modify variables outside their own scope.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Function Recap

```go
package piscine

func PointOne(n *int) {
	*n = 1
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Summary of Key Concepts

| Concept        | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `*int`         | A pointer to an integer |
| `*n = 1`       | Dereferences the pointer and sets the value |
| `&n`           | Gets the address of a variable |
| Pointers       | Allow functions to modify variables outside their own scope |
