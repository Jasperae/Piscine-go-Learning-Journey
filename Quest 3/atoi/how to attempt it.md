Let’s break down the `Atoi` function line by line so you understand *why* it works — not just what it does. This will help you build it from scratch and handle edge cases with confidence.

---

## 🎯 Goal Recap

Create a function:
```go
func Atoi(s string) int
```
That:
- Converts a string like `"123"` into the integer `123`
- Handles optional signs: `+` or `-`
- Returns `0` if the string contains any invalid characters

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Theory

### 1. **Initialize Variables**
```go
x := 0
si := 1
```

- `x` will hold the final integer result
- `si` is the sign indicator: `1` for positive, `-1` for negative

> ✅ This sets up the accumulator and sign tracker.

---

### 2. **Loop Through Each Character**
```go
for j, i := range s {
```

- `j` is the index (position in the string)
- `i` is the rune (character) at that position

> ✅ This lets you inspect each character and its position.

---

### 3. **Handle Leading Sign**
```go
if s[j] == '-' && j == 0 {
	si = -1
	continue
}
if s[j] == '+' && j == 0 {
	continue
}
```

- If the first character is `-`, set sign to negative
- If it’s `+`, skip it
- Only valid at position `0` — signs in other positions are invalid

> ✅ This handles optional signs correctly.

---

### 4. **Validate Digits**
```go
if i < '0' || i > '9' {
	return 0
}
```

- If the character is not between `'0'` and `'9'`, return `0`
- This catches invalid input like `"12a3"` or `"01 23"`

> ✅ Ensures only valid digits are processed.

---

### 5. **Convert Character to Integer**
```go
y := 0
for k := '1'; k <= i; k++ {
	y++
}
```

- This loop counts how many steps from `'1'` to the current digit
- Effectively converts `'0'` to `0`, `'1'` to `1`, ..., `'9'` to `9`

> ✅ This avoids casting — a requirement of the exercise.

---

### 6. **Build the Number**
```go
x = x*10 + y
```

- Multiplies the current number by 10 and adds the new digit
- This shifts digits left and appends the new one

> ✅ This builds the full number correctly.

---

### 7. **Return Final Result**
```go
return x * si
```

- Applies the sign to the final number

> ✅ This gives the correct signed integer.

---

## ✅ Final Function Recap

```go
func Atoi(s string) int {
	x := 0
	si := 1
	for j, i := range s {
		if s[j] == '-' && j == 0 {
			si = -1
			continue
		}
		if s[j] == '+' && j == 0 {
			continue
		}
		if i < '0' || i > '9' {
			return 0
		}
		y := 0
		for k := '1'; k <= i; k++ {
			y++
		}
		x = x*10 + y
	}
	return x * si
}
```

## 🛠️ Summary of Key Concepts

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `si := 1` | Tracks sign of the number |
| `if s[j] == '-' && j == 0` | Handles negative sign |
| `if i < '0' || i > '9'` | Validates digit characters |
| `for k := '1'; k <= i; k++` | Converts rune to integer without casting |
| `x = x*10 + y` | Builds the number from digits |
| `return x * si` | Applies sign to result |
