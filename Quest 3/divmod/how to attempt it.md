Absolutely ‚Äî let‚Äôs break this down so you understand *why* every part of the `DivMod` function works. We‚Äôll go from ‚Äújust memorizing syntax‚Äù to ‚Äúfully understanding pointers, division, and how Go handles memory.‚Äù

---

## üéØ Goal Recap

You‚Äôre writing a function:
```go
func DivMod(a int, b int, div *int, mod *int)
```
That:
- Divides `a` by `b` and stores the result in the variable pointed to by `div`
- Computes the remainder of `a` divided by `b` and stores it in the variable pointed to by `mod`

---

## üß† Step-by-Step Theory

### 1. **Function Signature with Pointers**
```go
func DivMod(a int, b int, div *int, mod *int)
```

- `a` and `b` are regular integers
- `div` and `mod` are **pointers to integers**
  - A pointer holds the memory address of a variable
  - So `*div` means ‚Äúthe value stored at the memory address `div` points to‚Äù

> ‚úÖ This allows the function to **modify variables outside its own scope**.

---

### 2. **Division Operation**
```go
*div = a / b
```

- `a / b` performs integer division
  - Example: `13 / 2 = 6`
- `*div = ...` stores the result in the variable that `div` points to

> ‚úÖ This updates the caller‚Äôs `div` variable with the quotient.

---

### 3. **Modulo Operation**
```go
*mod = a % b
```

- `a % b` computes the remainder
  - Example: `13 % 2 = 1`
- `*mod = ...` stores the result in the variable that `mod` points to

> ‚úÖ This updates the caller‚Äôs `mod` variable with the remainder.

---

### 4. **Why Use Pointers Here?**

In Go, function arguments are passed **by value** by default. That means:
- If you passed `div` and `mod` as regular `int` values, the function would only modify local copies.
- By passing **pointers**, you allow the function to update the original variables in `main()`.

> ‚úÖ This is a classic use case for pointers: returning multiple values via memory references.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Function Recap

```go
package piscine

func DivMod(a int, b int, div *int, mod *int) {
	*div = a / b
	*mod = a % b
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Summary of Key Concepts

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `*div = a / b` | Stores quotient in the caller‚Äôs variable |
| `*mod = a % b` | Stores remainder in the caller‚Äôs variable |
| `div *int` | Pointer to an integer ‚Äî allows modification |
| `*div` | Dereferencing ‚Äî accessing the value at the pointer |
| Pointers | Enable functions to return multiple results by modifying caller‚Äôs variables |
