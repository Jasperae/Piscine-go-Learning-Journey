Let’s break down this `BasicAtoi2` function line by line so you understand *why* it works — not just what it does. This will help you build it from scratch and confidently handle edge cases.

---

## 🎯 Objective Recap

You’re writing a function:
```go
func BasicAtoi2(s string) int
```
That:
- Converts a string of digits (e.g. `"12345"`) into an integer (`12345`)
- Returns `0` if the string contains **any non-digit characters**
- Does **not** handle signs (`+` or `-`)
- Does **not** use built-in conversion like `strconv.Atoi`

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Theory

### 1. **Function Signature**
```go
func BasicAtoi2(s string) int
```

- `s` is the input string
- The function returns an `int`

---

### 2. **Initialize the Result**
```go
x := 0
```

- `x` will accumulate the final integer value
- Starts at 0 and builds up as we process each digit

---

### 3. **Loop Through Each Character**
```go
for _, i := range s {
```

- `range s` iterates over each character (rune) in the string
- `i` is the current character (e.g. `'1'`, `'2'`, etc.)

> ✅ This lets us process each digit one by one.

---

### 4. **Validate That Character Is a Digit**
```go
if i < '0' || i > '9' {
	return 0
}
```

- If the character is not between `'0'` and `'9'`, return `0`
- This catches invalid input like `"12a3"` or `"01 23"` or `"Hello"`

> ✅ Ensures only valid digits are processed.

---

### 5. **Convert Character to Integer (Without Casting)**
```go
y := 0
for j := '1'; j <= i; j++ {
	y++
}
```

This is the clever part:
- It counts how many steps from `'1'` to the current character
- For example:
  - If `i == '1'`, loop runs once → `y = 1`
  - If `i == '2'`, loop runs twice → `y = 2`
  - If `i == '0'`, loop doesn’t run → `y = 0`

> ✅ This avoids using `int(i - '0')`, which would be a cast — and casting is not allowed.

---

### 6. **Build the Number**
```go
x = x*10 + y
```

- This shifts the current number left by one digit (`x * 10`)
- Then adds the new digit `y`

For example:
- Processing `'1'`: `x = 0*10 + 1 = 1`
- Then `'2'`: `x = 1*10 + 2 = 12`
- Then `'3'`: `x = 12*10 + 3 = 123`

> ✅ This builds the full number digit by digit.

---

### 7. **Return the Result**
```go
return x
```

- After the loop, `x` holds the full integer value
- Return it

---

## ✅ Final Function Recap

```go
func BasicAtoi2(s string) int {
	x := 0
	for _, i := range s {
		if i < '0' || i > '9' {
			return 0
		}
		y := 0
		for j := '1'; j <= i; j++ {
			y++
		}
		x = x*10 + y
	}
	return x
}
```

## 🛠️ Summary of Key Concepts

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `x := 0` | Accumulator for the result |
| `range s` | Loops through each character |
| `if i < '0' || i > '9'` | Validates digit characters |
| `for j := '1'; j <= i; j++` | Converts rune to digit without casting |
| `x = x*10 + y` | Builds the number from left to right |
| `return x` | Returns the final integer |
