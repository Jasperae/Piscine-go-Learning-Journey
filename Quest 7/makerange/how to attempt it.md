Absolutely! Let’s break down the `MakeRange` function step by step so you understand **why** each part works—not just how. This will turn it from something you memorize into something you can confidently rebuild and even adapt for more complex tasks.

## 🧠 Goal of the Function

We want to write a function:

```go
func MakeRange(min, max int) []int
```

That:

- Returns a slice of integers starting from `min` up to (but not including) `max`
- If `min >= max`, returns `nil`
- Does **not** use `append` (as per the exercise constraint)

---

## ✅ Full Code

```go
func MakeRange(min, max int) []int {
	size := max - min

	if size <= 0 {
		return nil
	}
	answer := make([]int, size)
	for i := range answer {
		answer[i] = min
		min++
	}
	return answer
}
```

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Theory

### 1. `size := max - min`

- Calculates how many numbers should be in the range.
- This helps us determine if the range is valid.
- If `min = 5` and `max = 10`, then `size = 5` → valid
- If `min = 10` and `max = 5`, then `size = -5` → invalid

---

### 2. `if size <= 0 { return nil }`

- If the range is invalid (min ≥ max), return `nil`.
- This matches the expected behavior in the instructions.

---

### 3. `answer := make([]int, size)`

- Creates a slice of integers with a fixed size.
- `make` is allowed here because we’re not using `append`.
- This pre-allocates memory for the exact number of elements we need.

---

### 4. `for i := range answer`

- Loops through each index of the slice.
- `range answer` gives us the index values from `0` to `size-1`.

---

### 5. `answer[i] = min; min++`

- Assigns the current value of `min` to the slice at index `i`.
- Then increments `min` so the next value is one higher.

### Example:
If `min = 5` and `max = 10`, the loop will fill:
```go
answer[0] = 5
answer[1] = 6
answer[2] = 7
answer[3] = 8
answer[4] = 9
```

---

### 6. `return answer`

- Returns the completed slice.

---

## 🧪 Example Execution

```go
MakeRange(5, 10) → [5 6 7 8 9]
MakeRange(10, 5) → nil
MakeRange(3, 3)  → nil
MakeRange(-2, 2) → [-2 -1 0 1]
```

## ✅ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `max - min` | Determines range size |
| `make([]int, size)` | Initializes fixed-size slice |
| `range` over slice | Iterates through indices |
| `min++` | Increments value for next slot |
| `nil` return | Handles invalid range |
