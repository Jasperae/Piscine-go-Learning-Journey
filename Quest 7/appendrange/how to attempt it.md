Absolutely! Let’s break down the `AppendRange` function step by step so you understand **why** each part works—not just how. By the end, you’ll be able to build it from scratch and even adapt it for more complex range generation tasks.

---

## 🧠 Goal of the Function

We want to write a function:

```go
func AppendRange(min, max int) []int
```

That:

- Returns a slice of integers starting from `min` up to (but not including) `max`
- If `min >= max`, returns `nil`
- Does **not** use `make` (as per the exercise constraint)

---

## ✅ Full Code

```go
func AppendRange(min, max int) []int {
	size := max - min
	answer := []int{}
	if size <= 0 {
		return nil
	}
	for i := min; i < max; i++ {
		answer = append(answer, i)
	}
	return answer
}
```

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `size := max - min`

- Calculates how many numbers should be in the range.
- This helps us determine if the range is valid.
- If `min = 5` and `max = 10`, then `size = 5` → valid
- If `min = 10` and `max = 5`, then `size = -5` → invalid

---

### 2. `answer := []int{}`

- Initializes an empty slice of integers.
- We’ll use `append` to grow this slice dynamically.
- Why not use `make`?
  - The exercise explicitly disallows it.
  - `make` would preallocate memory, but here we build the slice incrementally.

---

### 3. `if size <= 0 { return nil }`

- If the range is invalid (min ≥ max), return `nil`.
- This matches the expected behavior in the instructions.

---

### 4. `for i := min; i < max; i++`

- Loops from `min` up to (but not including) `max`.
- This ensures `max` is excluded, as required.

---

### 5. `answer = append(answer, i)`

- Adds each value to the slice.
- `append` handles the memory allocation internally.

---

### 6. `return answer`

- Returns the completed slice.

---

## 🧪 Example Execution

```go
AppendRange(5, 10) → [5 6 7 8 9]
AppendRange(10, 5) → nil
AppendRange(3, 3)  → nil
AppendRange(-2, 2) → [-2 -1 0 1]
```

## ✅ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `max - min` | Determines range size |
| `[]int{}` | Initializes empty slice |
| `append` | Adds values dynamically |
| `nil` return | Handles invalid range |
| `for i := min; i < max` | Iterates through valid range |
