Great! Let‚Äôs break down the `SplitWhiteSpaces` function so you understand **every single part**‚Äînot just how it works, but **why** it works. This will turn it from something you memorize into something you can confidently build and adapt.

---

## üß† Goal of the Function

We want to write a function:

```go
func SplitWhiteSpaces(s string) []string
```

That:

- Takes a string `s`
- Splits it into words using **spaces**, **tabs**, and **newlines** as separators
- Returns a slice of strings, each representing a word

---

## ‚úÖ Full Code

```go
func SplitWhiteSpaces(str string) []string {
	splitStr := make([]string, 0)
	word := ""

	for _, char := range str {
		if char != ' ' {
			word += string(char)
		} else {
			if word != "" {
				splitStr = append(splitStr, word)
			}
			word = ""
		}
	}

	if word != "" {
		splitStr = append(splitStr, word)
	}
	return splitStr
}
```

## üîç Step-by-Step Theory

### 1. `splitStr := make([]string, 0)`

- Initializes an empty slice to store the words.
- We use `make` to create a slice with zero initial elements.

---

### 2. `word := ""`

- Holds the current word being built.
- As we loop through each character, we build up this word until we hit a separator.

---

### 3. `for _, char := range str`

- Loops through each character in the string.
- `range` over a string gives us **runes**, which are Unicode-safe.

---

### 4. `if char != ' '`

- Checks if the character is **not** a space.
- If it‚Äôs not a space, we add it to the current word.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This version only checks for `' '` (space). To fully match the instructions, we should also check for `'\t'` (tab) and `'\n'` (newline):

```go
if char != ' ' && char != '\t' && char != '\n'
```

---

### 5. `word += string(char)`

- Adds the character to the current word.
- We use `string(char)` to convert the rune to a string.

---

### 6. `if word != "" { splitStr = append(splitStr, word) }`

- When we hit a separator, we check if `word` is non-empty.
- If it is, we add it to the result slice.
- Then we reset `word` to start building the next word.

---

### 7. Final check after the loop

```go
if word != "" {
	splitStr = append(splitStr, word)
}
```

- After the loop ends, we might still have a word that wasn‚Äôt followed by a separator.
- This ensures the last word is included.

---

## üß™ Example Execution

```go
SplitWhiteSpaces("Hello how are you?")
‚Üí []string{"Hello", "how", "are", "you?"}
```

### With tabs and newlines:
```go
SplitWhiteSpaces("Hello\tworld\nGo")
‚Üí []string{"Hello", "world", "Go"}
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `make([]string, 0)` | Initializes result slice |
| `word` | Builds each word character by character |
| `range str` | Iterates safely over Unicode characters |
| `char != ' '` | Detects separators |
| `append(splitStr, word)` | Adds completed words to result |
| Final check | Captures last word if no trailing separator |

---

## üßº Optional Enhancements

To fully match the instructions, update the separator check:

```go
if char != ' ' && char != '\t' && char != '\n'
```
