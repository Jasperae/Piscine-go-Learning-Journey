Absolutely! Let‚Äôs turn this from memorizing code into **fully understanding how to build it from scratch**. We‚Äôll walk through the `PrintWordsTables` function line by line, explaining the **why** behind each decision so you can confidently recreate or adapt it.

---

## üß† Goal of the Function

We want to write a function:

```go
func PrintWordsTables(a []string)
```

That:

- Takes a slice of strings (`a`)
- Prints each string on a **separate line**
- Uses `z01.PrintRune` to print characters one by one (as required in 01-edu projects)

---

## ‚úÖ Full Code

```go
func PrintWordsTables(a []string) {
	for _, word := range a {
		for _, ch := range word {
			z01.PrintRune(ch)
		}
		z01.PrintRune('\n')
	}
}
```

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `for _, word := range a`

- Loops through each element in the slice `a`.
- `word` is a string like `"Hello"`, `"how"`, etc.
- We use `_` because we don‚Äôt need the index‚Äîjust the value.

---

### 2. `for _, ch := range word`

- Loops through each character (rune) in the string `word`.
- Why use `range` over a string?
  - Go strings are made of bytes, but characters (especially Unicode ones) can be multiple bytes.
  - `range` over a string gives you **runes**, which are Unicode-safe.

---

### 3. `z01.PrintRune(ch)`

- Prints each character one by one.
- `z01.PrintRune` is required in 01-edu projects instead of `fmt.Print`.

---

### 4. `z01.PrintRune('\n')`

- After printing all characters in a word, we print a newline.
- This ensures each word appears on its own line.

---

## üß™ Example Execution

```go
a := []string{"Hello", "how", "are", "you?"}
PrintWordsTables(a)
```

Output:
```
Hello
how
are
you?
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `range a` | Iterates through each word |
| `range word` | Iterates through each character |
| `z01.PrintRune` | Prints each character individually |
| `'\n'` | Adds a line break after each word |

---

## üßº Optional Enhancements

If you ever want to print all words on one line separated by spaces, you could modify it like this:

```go
for i, word := range a {
	for _, ch := range word {
		z01.PrintRune(ch)
	}
	if i != len(a)-1 {
		z01.PrintRune(' ')
	}
}
z01.PrintRune('\n')
```
