Absolutely! Let’s break down the `ToUpper` function so you understand **every decision and every line**—not just how it works, but **why** it works. By the end, you’ll be able to build it from scratch and even adapt it for other character transformations.

## 🧠 Goal of the Function

We want to write a function:

```go
func ToUpper(s string) string
```

That:

- Takes a string `s`
- Converts **every lowercase letter** to its uppercase equivalent
- Leaves all other characters (punctuation, digits, spaces, uppercase letters) unchanged

---

## ✅ Full Code

```go
func ToUpper(s string) string {
	r := []rune(s)
	for i := range r {
		if r[i] >= 97 && r[i] <= 122 {
			r[i] -= 32
		}
	}
	return string(r)
}
```

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `r := []rune(s)`

- Converts the string `s` into a slice of **runes**.
- Why use runes?
  - Go strings are made of **bytes**, but characters (especially Unicode ones) can be multiple bytes.
  - A **rune** is a Unicode code point, represented as `int32`.
  - This ensures we correctly handle all characters, even non-ASCII ones.

---

### 2. `for i := range r`

- Loops through each index `i` in the rune slice.
- We use `r[i]` to access each character.

---

### 3. `if r[i] >= 97 && r[i] <= 122`

- Checks if the character is a lowercase ASCII letter.
- ASCII values:
  - `'a'` = 97
  - `'z'` = 122
- So this condition identifies all lowercase letters.

---

### 4. `r[i] -= 32`

- Converts the lowercase letter to uppercase.
- `'A' - 'a'` = -32
- So subtracting 32 from a lowercase letter gives its uppercase equivalent.

### Example:
```go
'h' → 104
'h' - 32 → 72 → 'H'
```

---

### 5. `return string(r)`

- Converts the modified rune slice back into a string and returns it.

---

## 🧪 Example Execution

```go
ToUpper("Hello! How are you?") → "HELLO! HOW ARE YOU?"
ToUpper("123abc") → "123ABC"
ToUpper("ALREADY UPPERCASE") → "ALREADY UPPERCASE"
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `[]rune(s)` | Converts string to Unicode-aware slice |
| ASCII range check | Detects lowercase letters |
| `- 32` | Converts to uppercase |
| `string(r)` | Rebuilds the final string |

---

## 🧼 Optional Enhancements

### Unicode-safe version:

If you want to support full Unicode case conversion (e.g., accented letters, non-Latin scripts), use Go’s standard library:

```go
import "strings"

func ToUpper(s string) string {
	return strings.ToUpper(s)
}
```

But for learning and understanding ASCII transformations, your version is perfect.
