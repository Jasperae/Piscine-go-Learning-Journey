Alright Jasper — let’s break this down like you’re learning to code for the very first time. I’ll walk you through every part of this `quadA.go` file like you’re a curious child asking, “What does this do?” and I’ll explain it in the simplest, clearest way possible.

---

## 🧠 What Is This File?

This is a Go program that draws a box using characters like `o`, `-`, `|`, and spaces. The box changes size depending on what numbers you give it when you run the program.

You run it like this:

```bash
./quadA 3 3
```

And it prints:

```
o-o
| |
o-o
```

---

## 🧩 Let’s Break It Down Line by Line

### 1. 📦 `package main`

This tells Go:  
> “This is a program that can run by itself.”

Every Go program that you want to run directly must start with `package main`.

---

### 2. 📚 `import (...)`

You’re bringing in tools from Go’s toolbox:

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
)
```

- `fmt`: lets you print things to the screen
- `os`: lets you read things from the command line
- `strconv`: lets you turn text into numbers

---

### 3. 🧠 `func main()`

This is the **main function** — the brain of your program. It runs first when you type:

```bash
./quadA 3 3
```

Let’s walk through what it does:

#### a. 🧮 Check for 2 arguments

```go
if len(os.Args) != 3 {
	fmt.Println("Usage: ./quadA <width> <height>")
	return
}
```

This says:
> “If you didn’t give me two numbers, I’ll show you how to use me and then stop.”

---

#### b. 🔢 Convert those arguments to numbers

```go
x, err1 := strconv.Atoi(os.Args[1])
y, err2 := strconv.Atoi(os.Args[2])
```

This turns the text `"3"` and `"3"` into real numbers: `x = 3`, `y = 3`.

If it fails (like if you typed `"apple"`), it shows an error:

```go
if err1 != nil || err2 != nil {
	fmt.Println("Invalid dimensions")
	return
}
```

---

#### c. 🧱 Call the box-drawing function

```go
QuadA(x, y)
```

This says:
> “Now that I have the size, go draw the box!”

---

### 4. 🧱 `func QuadA(x, y int)`

This is the **box-drawing function**. It builds the box line by line.

Let’s break it into parts:

---

#### a. 🚫 Check for bad sizes

```go
if x <= 0 || y <= 0 {
	return
}
```

If the size is zero or negative, it stops. You can’t draw a box with no width or height!

---

#### b. 🧵 Draw the top line

```go
if x == 1 {
	fmt.Println("o")
} else {
	fmt.Print("o")
	for i := 0; i < x-2; i++ {
		fmt.Print("-")
	}
	fmt.Println("o")
}
```

This draws the top edge of the box:
- If width is 1 → just print `"o"`
- If width is more → print `"o"`, then some `"-"` dashes, then another `"o"`

Example for width 3:
```
o-o
```

---

#### c. 🧍 Draw the middle rows

```go
for i := 0; i < y-2; i++ {
	if x == 1 {
		fmt.Println("|")
	} else {
		fmt.Print("|")
		for i := 0; i < x-2; i++ {
			fmt.Print(" ")
		}
		fmt.Println("|")
	}
}
```

This draws the middle part of the box:
- If height is more than 2, it adds rows
- Each row starts and ends with `"|"` (the sides)
- Inside is filled with spaces

Example for width 3:
```
| |
```

---

#### d. 🧵 Draw the bottom line

```go
if y > 1 {
	if x == 1 {
		fmt.Println("o")
	} else {
		fmt.Print("o")
		for i := 0; i < x-2; i++ {
			fmt.Print("-")
		}
		fmt.Println("o")
	}
}
```

This draws the bottom edge — same as the top.

## 🎉 Jasper, You Did a Great Job

You didn’t just write code — you built a **real tool** that takes input, checks for errors, and prints a clean result. You used:
- Command-line arguments
- Loops
- Conditions
- Modular functions

If you want, I can help you write a README file, add comments to every line, or even animate the box drawing step by step. You’re building like a pro.



Jasper, you’ve done an **incredible job** — and I’m going to walk you through this `main.go` file like you’re learning it for the very first time. Imagine you’re a curious kid asking, “What does this do?” and I’m your friendly guide explaining every piece in simple, clear language.

---

## 🧠 What Is This File?

This is the **quadchecker** — a program that reads a box made of characters (like `o`, `-`, `A`, `B`, etc.) and figures out **which quad function created it**.

You don’t give it numbers like `3 3`. Instead, you give it a box — and it becomes a detective 🕵️‍♂️.

---

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. 📦 `package main`

This tells Go: “This is a program that can run on its own.”

---

### 2. 📚 `import (...)`

You’re bringing in tools from Go’s toolbox:

- `bufio`: helps read input line by line
- `fmt`: lets you print messages
- `os`: lets you talk to the computer (like reading input)
- `strings`: helps you work with text

---

### 3. 📏 `getDimensions(input string)`

This is a **helper function**. It looks at the box and says:
> “How wide and tall is this?”

It:
- Splits the box into lines
- Counts how many lines = height
- Counts how many characters in the first line = width

Example:
```
o-o
| |
o-o
```
→ width = 3, height = 3

---

### 4. 🧱 `generateQuadA(x, y int) string`

This builds a box using quadA’s style:
- Corners: `o`
- Top/bottom: `-`
- Sides: `|`
- Inside: spaces

You do the same for `quadB`, `quadC`, `quadD`, and `quadE`, each with their own style.

These are **helper functions** too — they don’t run on their own, but they help the checker compare patterns.

---

### 5. 🧠 `func main()`

This is the brain of your program. It runs when you type:

```bash
./quadchecker
```

Let’s walk through what it does:

---

### 🔹 a. Reads the box from input

```go
scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
```

This says: “Listen to whatever is piped into me.”

Example:
```bash
./quadA 3 3 | ./quadchecker
```

Here, `quadchecker` reads the box printed by `quadA`.

---

### 🔹 b. Joins the lines into one string

```go
input := strings.Join(lines, "\n")
```

Now the box looks like:
```
o-o
| |
o-o
```

---

### 🔹 c. Gets the dimensions

```go
width, height := getDimensions(input)
```

Now it knows: “This box is 3 wide and 3 tall.”

---

### 🔹 d. Generates all five quad patterns

```go
patterns := map[string]string{
  "quadA": generateQuadA(width, height),
  ...
}
```

It builds five boxes using the same size — one for each quad style.

---

### 🔹 e. Compares them to the input

```go
if input == patterns[name] {
  matches = append(...)
}
```

It checks: “Does this box match quadA? quadB? quadC?”

If yes, it adds that name to the list.

---

### 🔹 f. Prints the result

```go
fmt.Println(strings.Join(matches, " || "))
```

If it finds matches, it prints them like this:
```
[quadC] [1] [1] || [quadD] [1] [1] || [quadE] [1] [1]
```

If it finds nothing:
```
Not a quad function
```
