Absolutely! Let’s break this down so you understand **every single part** of the solution—not just how it works, but **why** it works. By the end, you’ll be able to write this from scratch and even optimize or adapt it for other use cases.

## 🧠 Goal of the Function

We want to write a function `IterativePower(nb int, power int) int` that:

- Returns the result of raising `nb` to the power of `power` (i.e., \( nb^{power} \))
- Uses **iteration**, not recursion
- Returns `0` for negative powers
- Ignores overflow (we don’t have to handle it)

---

## ✅ Full Code

```go
func IterativePower(nb int, power int) int {
	if power < 0 {
		return 0
	} else if power == 0 {
		return 1
	}
	result := 1
	for i := 0; i < power; i++ {
		result *= nb
	}
	return result
}
```

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `func IterativePower(nb int, power int) int {`

- This defines a function named `IterativePower`.
- It takes two integers:
  - `nb`: the base
  - `power`: the exponent
- It returns an integer result.

---

### 2. `if power < 0 { return 0 }`

- **Guard clause**: handles invalid input.
- In this exercise, negative exponents are considered invalid.
- So we return `0` immediately if `power` is negative.

---

### 3. `else if power == 0 { return 1 }`

- Any number raised to the power of `0` is `1` (by definition).
- So we return `1` for this special case.

---

### 4. `result := 1`

- We initialize a variable `result` to `1`.
- This is the **multiplicative identity**—the neutral element for multiplication.
- It’s the starting point for building the power result.

---

### 5. `for i := 0; i < power; i++ { result *= nb }`

- This is the **iterative loop** that multiplies `nb` by itself `power` times.
- Each loop iteration multiplies the current `result` by `nb`.

### Example: `IterativePower(4, 3)`
- Start: `result = 1`
- Loop:
  - `i = 0` → `result = 1 * 4 = 4`
  - `i = 1` → `result = 4 * 4 = 16`
  - `i = 2` → `result = 16 * 4 = 64`
- Done → return `64`

---

### 6. `return result`

- After the loop finishes, we return the final result.

## 🧪 Example Outputs

```go
IterativePower(2, 3) // 8
IterativePower(5, 0) // 1
IterativePower(3, -2) // 0
IterativePower(10, 2) // 100
```

## 🧼 Optional Enhancements

### Use exponentiation by squaring (for performance):

If you wanted to optimize for large exponents, you could use a faster algorithm like **exponentiation by squaring**, which reduces time complexity from O(n) to O(log n). But for this exercise, the simple loop is perfect.

## ✅ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `power < 0` | Invalid input → return 0 |
| `power == 0` | Base case → return 1 |
| `result := 1` | Start with neutral multiplication value |
| Loop from `0` to `power` | Multiply `nb` repeatedly |
| `result *= nb` | Build the power step-by-step |
| `return result` | Return the final computed value |
