Absolutely! Let's break this down so you understand **every concept, every decision, and every line** of this solution to the Eight Queens puzzle. By the end, you'll be able to build it from scratch and even adapt it to solve similar problems like N-Queens or Sudoku.

## üß† Problem Overview: Eight Queens Puzzle

The goal is to place **8 queens on an 8√ó8 chessboard** such that:

- No two queens threaten each other.
- That means: no two queens share the same **row**, **column**, or **diagonal**.

We want to **print all valid solutions**, where each solution is a sequence of 8 digits:
- Each digit represents the **row position** of the queen in that column.
- For example, `15863724` means:
  - Column 1 ‚Üí Row 1
  - Column 2 ‚Üí Row 5
  - Column 3 ‚Üí Row 8
  - ‚Ä¶ and so on.

---

## ‚úÖ Full Code Breakdown

### 1. `const BoardSize = 8`

- We define a constant for the board size.
- This makes the code flexible if we want to solve N-Queens later.

---

### 2. `type ChessBoard [BoardSize]int`

- We define a custom type `ChessBoard` as an array of 8 integers.
- Each index represents a **column**, and the value at that index is the **row** where the queen is placed.

---

### 3. `func isSafe(board *ChessBoard, row, col int) bool`

This function checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` is safe.

#### How does it work?

We loop through all previously placed queens (from row 0 to `row-1`) and check:

```go
diff := board[i] - col
```

Then we check three conditions:

- `diff == 0`: same column ‚Üí ‚ùå
- `diff == row - i`: same diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) ‚Üí ‚ùå
- `diff == -(row - i)`: same diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) ‚Üí ‚ùå

If any of these are true, the position is unsafe.

### 4. `func solveNQueens(board *ChessBoard, row int, solutions *[][]int)`

This is the **recursive backtracking function** that builds solutions.

#### Base Case:
```go
if row == BoardSize {
    *solutions = append(*solutions, board[:])
    return
}
```

- If we've placed queens in all 8 rows, we found a valid solution.
- We append a copy of the board to the `solutions` slice.

#### Recursive Case:
```go
for col := 0; col < BoardSize; col++ {
    if isSafe(board, row, col) {
        board[row] = col
        solveNQueens(board, row+1, solutions)
    }
}
```

- We try placing a queen in every column of the current row.
- If it's safe, we place it and recurse to the next row.

This is classic **backtracking**:
- Try ‚Üí Recurse ‚Üí Undo if needed ‚Üí Try next

---

### 5. `func FindAllSolutions() [][]int`

This function initializes the board and collects all solutions.

```go
var solutions [][]int
board := &ChessBoard{}
solveNQueens(board, 0, &solutions)
return solutions
```

- We start with an empty board.
- Begin solving from row 0.
- Return all collected solutions.

---

### 6. `func EightQueens()`

This is the final function that prints the solutions.

```go
solutions := FindAllSolutions()
for _, solution := range solutions {
    for _, col := range solution {
        fmt.Print(col + 1)
    }
    fmt.Println()
}
```

#### Why `col + 1`?

- Go arrays are 0-indexed, but the puzzle expects positions starting from 1.
- So we add 1 to each column value before printing.

---

## üß™ Example Output

```
15863724
16837425
17468253
...
```

Each line is a valid configuration of 8 queens.

---

## üîÅ Why Recursion?

Recursion is perfect for problems like this because:

- Each decision (placing a queen) leads to a smaller subproblem (place next queen).
- Backtracking allows us to explore all possibilities efficiently.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ChessBoard` | Represents queen positions by column |
| `isSafe` | Checks for conflicts with previous queens |
| `solveNQueens` | Recursively builds valid solutions |
| `FindAllSolutions` | Initializes and collects all solutions |
| `EightQueens` | Prints each solution in required format |
