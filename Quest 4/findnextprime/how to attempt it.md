Absolutely! Let’s break this down so you understand **every decision, every optimization, and every line** of this solution. We’ll turn it from memorization into mastery—so you can build it from scratch, improve it, and even adapt it for larger prime searches.

## 🧠 Goal of the Function

We want to write a function `FindNextPrime(nb int)` that:

- Returns the **first prime number** that is **equal to or greater than** `nb`.
- Must be **optimized** to avoid timeouts—especially for large numbers.

---

## ✅ Full Code

```go
func FindNextPrime(nb int) int {
	if nb <= 2 {
		return 2
	}
	if nb%2 == 0 {
		nb = nb + 1
	}
	for {
		if Ispe(nb) {
			return nb
		}
		nb = nb + 2
	}
}

func Ispe(nb int) bool {
	if nb < 2 {
		return false
	}
	if nb%2 == 0 {
		return false
	}
	for i := 3; i <= nb/3; i = i + 2 {
		if nb%i == 0 {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 🔹 `func FindNextPrime(nb int) int {`

This is the main function. It takes an integer `nb` and returns the next prime number ≥ `nb`.

---

### 🔹 `if nb <= 2 { return 2 }`

- Prime numbers start from 2.
- If `nb` is less than or equal to 2, we return 2 directly.
- This is a **fast path** for small inputs.

---

### 🔹 `if nb%2 == 0 { nb = nb + 1 }`

- Even numbers (except 2) are **never prime**.
- If `nb` is even, we increment it to make it odd.
- This avoids checking even numbers in the loop, which saves time.

---

### 🔹 `for { if Ispe(nb) { return nb } nb = nb + 2 }`

- Infinite loop: we keep checking odd numbers starting from `nb`.
- `Ispe(nb)` checks if `nb` is prime.
- If it is, we return it.
- Otherwise, we skip to the next odd number (`nb + 2`).

### Why skip by 2?

- Because even numbers can’t be prime (except 2), we only check odd numbers.
- This **cuts the number of checks in half**, improving performance.

---

## 🔍 `func Ispe(nb int) bool`

This helper function checks if a number is prime.

---

### 🔹 `if nb < 2 { return false }`

- Numbers less than 2 are not prime.

---

### 🔹 `if nb%2 == 0 { return false }`

- Even numbers are not prime (except 2, which we already handled).

---

### 🔹 `for i := 3; i <= nb/3; i = i + 2 { if nb%i == 0 { return false } }`

- We loop through **odd divisors** starting from 3.
- We check if `nb` is divisible by any of them.
- If it is, it’s not prime.

### Why `i <= nb/3`?

- This is an optimization.
- Normally, we’d check up to `sqrt(nb)`, but `nb/3` is a reasonable upper bound for small numbers.
- It’s a trade-off between speed and correctness for the test cases.

---

### 🔹 `return true`

- If no divisors were found, the number is prime.

---

## 🧪 Example: `FindNextPrime(4)`

- 4 is even → increment to 5
- `Ispe(5)` → true → return 5

---

## 🧠 Optimization Summary

| Technique | Why It Helps |
|----------|--------------|
| Skip even numbers | Cuts checks in half |
| Early return for small values | Fast path for edge cases |
| Only check odd divisors | Avoids unnecessary work |
| Limit divisor range (`nb/3`) | Faster than checking all the way to `nb` |

---

## 🧼 Optional Improvements

For larger inputs, you could:

- Check up to `sqrt(nb)` instead of `nb/3`
- Use a sieve algorithm for bulk prime generation
- Cache known primes to avoid recomputation

---

## ✅ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `FindNextPrime` | Finds the next prime ≥ `nb` |
| `Ispe` | Checks if a number is prime |
| Skip evens | Faster search |
| Odd divisors only | Efficient primality test |
| Infinite loop + early return | Classic prime search pattern |
