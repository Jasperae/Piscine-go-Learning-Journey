Absolutely! Let‚Äôs break this down step by step so you understand **why** each part of this recursive factorial function works the way it does. By the end, you‚Äôll be able to write it from scratch, adapt it, and even optimize it.

## üß† What Is a Factorial?

The **factorial** of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

\[
n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \dots \cdot 1
\]

Examples:
- \( 0! = 1 \) (by definition)
- \( 4! = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24 \)

## ‚úÖ Full Code

```go
func RecursiveFactorial(nb int) int {
	if nb == 1 || nb == 0 {
		return 1
	} else if nb < 0 || nb > 20 {
		return 0
	}
	return nb * RecursiveFactorial(nb-1)
}
```

## üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `func RecursiveFactorial(nb int) int {`

- This defines a function named `RecursiveFactorial`.
- It takes an integer `nb` and returns an integer result.

---

### 2. `if nb == 1 || nb == 0 { return 1 }`

- These are the **base cases** of the recursion.
- Why?
  - \( 0! = 1 \)
  - \( 1! = 1 \)
- Without base cases, recursion would never stop‚Äîit would keep calling itself forever.

---

### 3. `else if nb < 0 || nb > 20 { return 0 }`

- This is a **guard clause** to handle invalid or unsafe input.
- Factorial is **undefined for negative numbers**, so we return `0`.
- Why `nb > 20`?
  - Because factorials grow **very fast**.
  - `21!` exceeds the maximum value of a 64-bit signed integer (`int`), causing **overflow**.
  - Returning `0` avoids incorrect results or crashes.

---

### 4. `return nb * RecursiveFactorial(nb-1)`

- This is the **recursive case**.
- We multiply `nb` by the factorial of `nb-1`.

### Example: `RecursiveFactorial(4)`
- `4 * RecursiveFactorial(3)`
- `4 * (3 * RecursiveFactorial(2))`
- `4 * (3 * (2 * RecursiveFactorial(1)))`
- `4 * (3 * (2 * 1)) = 24`

---

## üîÅ Why Recursion?

Recursion is perfect for problems like factorial because:

- The definition of factorial is **self-referential**: \( n! = n \cdot (n-1)! \)
- Each recursive call solves a smaller version of the same problem.
- Base cases stop the recursion.

---

## üß™ Example Outputs

```go
RecursiveFactorial(4) // 24
RecursiveFactorial(0) // 1
RecursiveFactorial(-3) // 0
RecursiveFactorial(21) // 0
```

---

## üßº Optional Enhancements

### Handle overflow more precisely:

Instead of hardcoding `nb > 20`, you could use `math.MaxInt64` and check dynamically if multiplication would overflow. But for this exercise, the hardcoded limit is fine.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `nb == 0 || nb == 1` | Base cases to stop recursion |
| `nb < 0 || nb > 20` | Prevent invalid input and overflow |
| `nb * RecursiveFactorial(nb-1)` | Recursive step to build factorial |
| Recursion | Elegant way to express self-referential problems |
