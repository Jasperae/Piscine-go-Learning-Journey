Absolutely! Let‚Äôs break this down so you understand **every line, every decision, and every optimization** in this prime-checking function. By the end, you‚Äôll be able to build it from scratch and even improve its performance for large numbers.

## üß† Goal of the Function

We want to write a function `IsPrime(nb int) bool` that:

- Returns `true` if `nb` is a **prime number**
- Returns `false` otherwise

### What is a Prime Number?

A prime number is a **positive integer greater than 1** that has **no divisors other than 1 and itself**.

Examples:
- ‚úÖ Prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13
- ‚ùå Not prime: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10

---

## ‚úÖ Full Code

```go
func IsPrime(nb int) bool {
	if nb < 2 {
		return false
	}
	for i := 2; i <= nb/2; i++ {
		if nb%i == 0 {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `if nb < 2 { return false }`

- Prime numbers are **greater than 1**
- So we immediately return `false` for:
  - Negative numbers
  - 0
  - 1

This is a **guard clause** to handle invalid inputs quickly.

---

### 2. `for i := 2; i <= nb/2; i++ {`

- We loop from `2` to `nb/2`
- Why `nb/2`?
  - Because no number greater than `nb/2` (except `nb` itself) can divide `nb` evenly
  - Example: 10 can‚Äôt be divided by anything > 5 except itself

### What does this loop do?

- It checks if any number between `2` and `nb/2` divides `nb` evenly
- If `nb % i == 0`, then `nb` is **not prime**

---

### 3. `if nb%i == 0 { return false }`

- If `nb` is divisible by `i`, it has a factor other than 1 and itself
- So it‚Äôs **not prime**, and we return `false` immediately

---

### 4. `return true`

- If the loop finishes without finding any divisors, `nb` is prime
- We return `true`

---

## üß† Optimization Opportunity

### Why is `nb/2` not optimal?

- We can do better: **check up to ‚àönb**
- If `nb` has a factor, one of them must be ‚â§ ‚àönb

### Improved version:

```go
import "math"

func IsPrime(nb int) bool {
	if nb < 2 {
		return false
	}
	sqrt := int(math.Sqrt(float64(nb)))
	for i := 2; i <= sqrt; i++ {
		if nb%i == 0 {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

### Why is this better?

- Reduces the number of checks dramatically for large numbers
- Example: for `nb = 10,000`, we check up to `100` instead of `5,000`

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `nb < 2` | Early exit for non-prime values |
| Loop from `2` to `nb/2` | Check for divisors |
| `%` operator | Tests if `nb` is divisible |
| `return false` | Found a divisor ‚Üí not prime |
| `return true` | No divisors ‚Üí prime |
| Optimization: `‚àönb` | Faster for large numbers |
