Absolutely! Let’s break this down so you understand **every decision and every line** of this square root function. We’ll go from memorizing code to **mastering the logic behind it**—so you can build it from scratch and even optimize it.

## 🧠 Goal of the Function

We want to write a function `Sqrt(nb int) int` that:

- Returns the **square root** of `nb` **if** it’s a **perfect square**
- Otherwise, returns `0`

### What’s a Perfect Square?

A number is a perfect square if its square root is a **whole number** (integer).

Examples:
- ✅ `4 → 2` (because \(2^2 = 4\))
- ❌ `3 → 0` (because \(\sqrt{3} ≈ 1.732\), not an integer)

---

## ✅ Full Code

```go
func Sqrt(nb int) int {
	for i := 0; i*i <= nb; i++ {
		if i*i == nb {
			return i
		}
	}
	return 0
}
```

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `func Sqrt(nb int) int {`

- This defines a function named `Sqrt`.
- It takes one integer `nb` and returns an integer result.

---

### 2. `for i := 0; i*i <= nb; i++ {`

- This is a **loop** that tries every integer `i` starting from `0`.
- The condition `i*i <= nb` ensures we don’t go past the square root.
- Why `i*i`?
  - Because we’re checking whether `i` squared equals `nb`.

### Example: `nb = 4`
- `i = 0` → `0*0 = 0` → not equal
- `i = 1` → `1*1 = 1` → not equal
- `i = 2` → `2*2 = 4` → match! return `2`

---

### 3. `if i*i == nb { return i }`

- If we find an `i` such that `i*i == nb`, then `i` is the square root.
- We return it immediately.

---

### 4. `return 0`

- If the loop finishes without finding a match, `nb` is **not** a perfect square.
- So we return `0`.

---

## 🧪 Example Outputs

```go
Sqrt(4) // 2
Sqrt(3) // 0
Sqrt(9) // 3
Sqrt(10) // 0
```

## 🧼 Optional Enhancements

### 1. Handle negative input:

```go
if nb < 0 {
	return 0
}
```

- Negative numbers don’t have real square roots in integer math.

### 2. Use binary search for performance:

For large `nb`, a binary search would be faster than linear iteration:

```go
func Sqrt(nb int) int {
	if nb < 0 {
		return 0
	}
	low, high := 0, nb
	for low <= high {
		mid := (low + high) / 2
		square := mid * mid
		if square == nb {
			return mid
		} else if square < nb {
			low = mid + 1
		} else {
			high = mid - 1
		}
	}
	return 0
}
```

## ✅ Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `i*i <= nb` | Loop until we pass the square root |
| `i*i == nb` | Check if `i` is the square root |
| `return i` | Found perfect square root |
| `return 0` | Not a perfect square |
| Optional: binary search | Faster for large numbers |
