Absolutely! Let‚Äôs break this down so you understand **every decision and every line** of this recursive power function. We‚Äôll go from ‚Äújust remembering the code‚Äù to **fully understanding how and why it works**‚Äîand how to build it yourself from scratch.

---

## üß† Goal of the Function

We want to write a function `RecursivePower(nb int, power int) int` that:

- Returns the result of raising `nb` to the power of `power` (i.e., \( nb^{power} \))
- Uses **recursion** (no loops allowed)
- Returns `0` for negative powers
- Ignores overflow (we don‚Äôt need to handle large number limits)

---

## ‚úÖ Full Code

```go
func RecursivePower(nb int, power int) int {
	if power < 0 {
		return 0
	} else if power < 1 {
		return 1
	}
	return nb * RecursivePower(nb, power-1)
}
```

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `func RecursivePower(nb int, power int) int {`

- This defines a function named `RecursivePower`.
- It takes two integers:
  - `nb`: the base
  - `power`: the exponent
- It returns an integer result.

---

### 2. `if power < 0 { return 0 }`

- This is a **guard clause**.
- In this exercise, negative exponents are considered invalid.
- So we return `0` immediately if `power` is negative.

---

### 3. `else if power < 1 { return 1 }`

- This handles the **base case** of the recursion.
- Any number raised to the power of `0` is `1` (by definition).
- So if `power` is `0`, we return `1`.

> Note: This also covers the case where `power == 0`, which is the only valid non-negative value less than 1.

---

### 4. `return nb * RecursivePower(nb, power-1)`

- This is the **recursive case**.
- We multiply `nb` by the result of `RecursivePower(nb, power-1)`.
- This continues until `power` reaches `0`, at which point we return `1`.

---

## üß™ Example: `RecursivePower(4, 3)`

Let‚Äôs walk through the call stack:

```
RecursivePower(4, 3)
= 4 * RecursivePower(4, 2)
= 4 * (4 * RecursivePower(4, 1))
= 4 * (4 * (4 * RecursivePower(4, 0)))
= 4 * (4 * (4 * 1))
= 4 * (4 * 4)
= 4 * 16
= 64
```

---

## üß† Why Recursion?

Recursion is a natural fit for problems that can be defined in terms of themselves. In this case:

\[
nb^{power} = nb \cdot nb^{power - 1}
\]

Each recursive call reduces the problem size by 1, until we hit the base case (`power == 0`).

---

## üßº Optional Enhancements

### Optimization: Exponentiation by Squaring

For large exponents, we can reduce the number of recursive calls by using **exponentiation by squaring**:

```go
func RecursivePower(nb int, power int) int {
	if power < 0 {
		return 0
	} else if power == 0 {
		return 1
	} else if power%2 == 0 {
		half := RecursivePower(nb, power/2)
		return half * half
	}
	return nb * RecursivePower(nb, power-1)
}
```

- This reduces the time complexity from **O(n)** to **O(log n)**.
- It‚Äôs more efficient for large powers.
