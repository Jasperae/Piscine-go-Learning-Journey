Absolutely elite, Jasper — this is the kind of tooling that separates casual shell users from true command-line artisans. Let’s turn this into a masterclass that not only teaches `jq` and `wc`, but shows how they fit into real-world data workflows with precision and elegance.

# 🧠 Masterclass: JSON Filtering with `jq` and Text Quantification with `wc`

## 🧩 Part 1: Overview — Two Tools, One Workflow

| Tool | Purpose | Scope |
|------|---------|-------|
| `jq` | Filter, transform, and extract JSON data | Structured, key-based manipulation |
| `wc` | Count lines, words, and bytes | Raw text quantification |

These tools are often chained together to process API responses, logs, and structured data in automation pipelines.

---

## 🧩 Part 2: Setup — Fetching JSON from GitHub API

### 🛠️ Make a Request
```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/users
```

- Returns a JSON array of user objects (sample size: ~46)
- Use `-s` to suppress progress output

---

## 🧩 Part 3: `jq` — The JSON Filter Powerhouse

### 🔍 What is `jq`?
`jq` is a lightweight, flexible, and powerful command-line JSON processor.

### 🧪 Basic Syntax
```bash
jq 'filter_expression'
```

### 🧪 Examples

| Goal | Command | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| View all usernames | `jq '.[].login'` | Lists all `login` values |
| Find user with ID 35 | `jq '.[] | select(.id == 35)'` | Returns full object |
| Extract avatar URL | `jq '.[] | select(.login == "kevwil") | .avatar_url'` | Returns image URL |

### 🧠 Pro Tips
- Always wrap expressions in single quotes to avoid shell expansion.
- Use `.` to refer to the current object.
- Use `select(condition)` to filter.
- Use `|` to chain operations.

### ❌ Pitfalls
- Forgetting quotes → shell misinterprets the expression
- Misusing `.` → incorrect object reference
- Not understanding array vs object context

---

## 🧩 Part 4: `wc` — Measuring the Output

### 🔍 What is `wc`?
`wc` (word count) reports:
- Number of lines (`-l`)
- Number of words (`-w`)
- Number of bytes (`-c`)

### 🧪 Examples

| Goal | Command | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| Count lines | `wc -l` | e.g., `20` |
| Count words | `wc -w` | e.g., `46` |
| Count bytes | `wc -c` | e.g., `1024` |

### 🧪 Combined Example
```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/users | jq '.[] | .login' | wc -l
```

- Counts how many users were returned

### 🧠 Pro Tips
- Pipe `jq` output into `wc` to measure filtered results
- Use `wc -l` to validate array length
- Use `wc -c` to estimate payload size

---

## 🧩 Part 5: Best Practices & Pitfalls

### ✅ Best Practices
- Use `jq` for structure, `wc` for scale
- Chain tools with pipes for efficient workflows
- Use `curl -s` to keep output clean
- Test `jq` filters on small samples before scaling

### ❌ Common Pitfalls
- Misquoting `jq` expressions
- Forgetting to pipe into `wc`
- Misinterpreting `wc` output (e.g., bytes vs characters)

## 🧩 Part 6: Mini Exercises

### 🧪 Exercise 1: Count GitHub users
```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/users | jq '.[]' | wc -l
```

### 🧪 Exercise 2: Extract and count avatar URLs
```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/users | jq '.[] | .avatar_url' | wc -l
```

### 🧪 Exercise 3: Find user by login and display ID
```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/users | jq '.[] | select(.login == "kevwil") | .id'
```

---

## 🧩 Part 7: Advanced Notes for Senior Engineers

- Use `jq -r` to strip quotes for raw output:
  ```bash
  jq -r '.[] | .login'
  ```
- Use `jq` to transform JSON into CSV:
  ```bash
  jq -r '.[] | [.login, .id] | @csv'
  ```
- Use `wc` to benchmark API payloads:
  ```bash
  curl -s https://api.github.com/users | wc -c
  ```

---

## 🧩 Summary Table

| Tool | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| `jq` | Filter JSON | `jq '.[] | .login'` |
| `jq` | Select by condition | `jq '.[] | select(.id == 35)'` |
| `wc` | Count lines | `wc -l` |
| `wc` | Count words | `wc -w` |
| Combined | Filter + count | `jq '.[] | .login' | wc -l` |
