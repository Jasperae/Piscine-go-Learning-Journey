Let’s break this down and understand exactly how to create a file with a **very unusual name** and put the content `01` inside it — and nothing else. We’ll go step by step so you understand the *why* behind every part of the solution.

## 🎯 Goal Recap

Create a file named:
```
"?$*'ChouMi'*$?\"
```
And make sure it contains:
```

01
```
— and nothing else.

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Theory

### 1. **Understanding the Filename**

The filename is:
```
"?$*'ChouMi'*$?\"
```

This includes:
- Special characters: `?`, `$`, `*`, `'`, `"`, and `\`
- These characters have **special meaning** in the shell:
  - `?` matches any single character
  - `*` matches any number of characters
  - `$` is used for variable expansion
  - `'` and `"` are used for quoting
  - `\` is an escape character

> ✅ To use this filename **literally**, we must **quote it properly** so the shell doesn’t interpret these characters.

---

### 2. **Quoting the Filename**

To safely use this filename in a command, wrap it in **single quotes**:
```bash
'$*'"'"'ChouMi'"'"'*$?"'
```

But that’s messy. The easiest and safest way is to use **double quotes** and escape the internal double quote and backslash:
```bash
"\"?\$*'ChouMi'*\$?\\\""
```

Or even better: use **single quotes** around the entire name:
```bash
'"?$*'\''ChouMi'\''*$?\"'
```

But for simplicity, you can use:
```bash
echo 01 > '"?\$*'ChouMi'*\$?\"'
```

Here’s what’s happening:
- `echo 01` prints `01`
- `>` redirects that output into a file
- The filename is quoted so the shell doesn’t interpret the special characters

---

### 3. **Verifying the File**

To check the file was created correctly:
```bash
ls | cat -e
```

This shows:
```
"?$*'ChouMi'*$?\"$
$
```

- `cat -e` shows `$` at the end of each line
- The second `$` is from the empty line after the output

To check the contents:
```bash
cat '"?\$*'ChouMi'*\$?\"'
```

Output:
```
01
```

---

## ✅ Final Command

```bash
echo 01 > '"?\$*'ChouMi'*\$?\"'
```

Or in script form (`cl-camp7.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo 01 > '"?\$*'ChouMi'*\$?\"'
```

## 🛠️ Summary of Key Concepts

| Concept | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Special characters | Must be quoted to avoid shell interpretation |
| `echo 01` | Writes `01` to standard output |
| `>` | Redirects output into a file |
| Quoting | Ensures filename is treated literally |
| `cat -e` | Shows end-of-line characters (`$`) |
