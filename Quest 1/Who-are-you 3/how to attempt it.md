Let‚Äôs break this down so you understand not just *what* this script does, but *why* every part of it works ‚Äî and how you could build it yourself from scratch.

## üéØ Goal Recap

Create a script `who-are-you.sh` that:
- Fetches superhero data from a JSON file online
- Filters for the superhero with `id: 70`
- Prints only their name
- Keeps the output exactly formatted like:
  ```
  "name"$
  $
  ```

---

## üß† Step-by-Step Theory

### 1. **Shebang: `#!/bin/bash`**
This line tells your system:
> ‚ÄúUse the Bash shell to interpret this script.‚Äù

It ensures consistent behavior across systems and shells.

---

### 2. **Fetching JSON with `curl`**
```bash
curl -s https://acad.learn2earn.ng/assets/superhero/all.json
```

- `curl` is a command-line tool to fetch data from URLs
- `-s` means ‚Äúsilent‚Äù ‚Äî it suppresses progress and error messages
- This downloads the JSON array of superhero objects

> ‚úÖ You now have the raw JSON data in your terminal

---

### 3. **Parsing JSON with `jq`**
```bash
jq '.[] | select(.id == 70) | .name'
```

Let‚Äôs break this down:
- `.[]`: iterates over each object in the array
- `select(.id == 70)`: filters for the object with `id` equal to `70`
- `.name`: extracts the `name` field from that object

> ‚úÖ This gives you the name of the superhero, still wrapped in quotes (as required)

---

### 4. **Putting It All Together**

Here‚Äôs the full script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
curl -s https://acad.learn2earn.ng/assets/superhero/all.json | jq '.[] | select(.id == 70) | .name'
```

- This fetches the data
- Filters for the superhero with ID 70
- Extracts and prints the name

---

### 5. **Verifying the Output Format**

When you run:
```bash
./who-are-you.sh | cat -e
```

You should see:
```
"name"$
$
```

- `cat -e` shows `$` at the end of each line
- The second `$` is from the empty line after the output

> ‚úÖ This confirms the output is exactly as required

## üõ†Ô∏è Summary of Key Concepts

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `#!/bin/bash` | Use Bash to run the script |
| `curl -s` | Fetch JSON data silently |
| `jq` | Parse and filter JSON |
| `.[]` | Iterate over array items |
| `select(.id == 70)` | Filter for superhero with ID 70 |
| `.name` | Extract the name field |
| `cat -e` | Show end-of-line characters for verification |
