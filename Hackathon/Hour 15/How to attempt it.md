Letâ€™s break this down and turn it into a full understanding of how to build this program from scratch â€” no memorization required. Youâ€™ll learn the **why** behind every line so you can confidently write similar programs on your own.

## ðŸ§  Problem Summary

Youâ€™re building a command-line program called `comcheck` that:
- Accepts arguments from the terminal.
- Checks if **any** of those arguments match one of three specific strings:
  - `"01"`
  - `"galaxy"`
  - `"galaxy 01"`
- If **any match is found**, print `Alert!!!`
- If **no match**, print nothing.

---

## ðŸ§© Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. **Import Required Packages**

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)
```

- `fmt`: For printing output (`fmt.Println`)
- `os`: Gives access to command-line arguments via `os.Args`

---

### 2. **Access Command-Line Arguments**

```go
os.Args
```

- This is a slice of strings: `[]string`
- `os.Args[0]` is the program name (e.g., `./comcheck`)
- `os.Args[1:]` are the actual arguments passed by the user

Example:
```bash
go run . "galaxy"
```
â†’ `os.Args = ["./comcheck", "galaxy"]`

---

### 3. **Check If Arguments Exist**

```go
if len(os.Args) > 1 {
```

- We only care about arguments beyond the program name.
- If no arguments are passed, we skip the check.

---

### 4. **Loop Through Arguments**

```go
for _, v := range os.Args[1:] {
```

- `range` lets us iterate over each argument.
- `v` is the value of each argument.

---

### 5. **Check for Matches**

```go
if v == "01" || v == "galaxy" || v == "galaxy 01" {
```

- We compare each argument to the three target strings.
- If any match is found, we print the alert.

---

### 6. **Print and Exit**

```go
fmt.Println("Alert!!!")
return
```

- Print the message.
- `return` exits the program early â€” no need to check further once a match is found.

---

## ðŸ§ª Example Run

```bash
go run . "galaxy 01" "do" "you" "hear" "me"
```

- `os.Args[1:] = ["galaxy 01", "do", "you", "hear", "me"]`
- `"galaxy 01"` matches â†’ prints `Alert!!!`

## âœ… Summary of Concepts

| Concept            | Why It Matters                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `os.Args`          | Accesses command-line input                  |
| `len(os.Args) > 1` | Ensures arguments exist                      |
| `range` loop       | Iterates through each argument               |
| `==` comparisons   | Checks for exact string matches              |
| `fmt.Println`      | Displays output                              |
| `return`           | Stops further checks once a match is found   |

Would you like to extend this to support case-insensitive matches or partial matches next? I can show you how to do that elegantly.
