Let’s go **deep** into the logic, the Go concepts, and the *why* behind every single part of that solution.
We’ll turn this from “memorizing code” → into “fully understanding how to build it from scratch.”

---

## 🧠 1️⃣ What the Problem Is Really Asking

The task is:

> Take a slice of strings (passed by pointer), remove all the empty strings (`""`),
> and return how many non-empty strings remain.

---

### Example

Before compacting:

```go
a := []string{"a", "", "b", "", "c", ""}
```

After compacting:

```go
a = []string{"a", "b", "c"}
```

Return value = `3` (the number of non-empty elements).

---

## ⚙️ 2️⃣ Why the Function Takes a Pointer

The function signature is:

```go
func Compact(ptr *[]string) int
```

Notice the `*[]string` — that’s a **pointer to a slice**.
Why not just `[]string`?

Because we want to **modify the original slice** that was given to us.

In Go, if we wrote:

```go
func Compact(a []string) int
```

and we changed `a` inside the function,
the *caller’s* slice wouldn’t be updated — we’d only be modifying a copy of the slice header.

✅ By passing a pointer, we can update the original slice directly using `*ptr`.

---

## 🧩 3️⃣ Breaking Down the Code Step-by-Step

Here’s the full code again:

```go
package piscine

func Compact(ptr *[]string) int {
	original := *ptr
	result := []string{}

	for _, str := range original {
		if str != "" {
			result = append(result, str)
		}
	}

	*ptr = result

	return len(result)
}
```

Let’s understand every line 👇

---

### 🧩 Step 1 — Dereference the Pointer

```go
original := *ptr
```

* `ptr` is a pointer to a slice (type: `*[]string`)
* `*ptr` gives us the actual slice (type: `[]string`)

So now `original` is just the slice we’ll loop over:

```
original = []string{"a", "", "b", "", "c", ""}
```

---

### 🧩 Step 2 — Create an Empty Result Slice

```go
result := []string{}
```

We’ll store all **non-empty** strings here.

At first:

```
result = []
```

---

### 🧩 Step 3 — Loop Over the Original Slice

```go
for _, str := range original {
	if str != "" {
		result = append(result, str)
	}
}
```

Let’s visualize this iteration:

| str | str != "" ? | action      | result after iteration |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| "a" | ✅ yes       | append("a") | ["a"]                  |
| ""  | ❌ no        | skip        | ["a"]                  |
| "b" | ✅ yes       | append("b") | ["a", "b"]             |
| ""  | ❌ no        | skip        | ["a", "b"]             |
| "c" | ✅ yes       | append("c") | ["a", "b", "c"]        |
| ""  | ❌ no        | skip        | ["a", "b", "c"]        |

---

### 🧩 Step 4 — Assign the New Slice Back to the Pointer

```go
*ptr = result
```

This is the **key line** — it replaces the original slice with the compacted one.

Before:

```
a = []string{"a", "", "b", "", "c", ""}
```

After:

```
a = []string{"a", "b", "c"}
```

---

### 🧩 Step 5 — Return the New Length

```go
return len(result)
```

`len(result)` = number of non-empty strings.

In our example:

```
len(result) = 3
```

---

## 🧠 4️⃣ Core Go Concepts at Work Here

Let’s unpack the Go principles this exercise teaches you.

---

### ✅ **1. Pointers and Dereferencing**

* `ptr` points to a slice (`*[]string`)
* `*ptr` gives the actual slice
* By assigning `*ptr = result`, we modify the caller’s variable directly.

Without pointers, `a` wouldn’t be updated in `main()`.

---

### ✅ **2. Zero Value Concept**

In Go, the *zero value* of a string is:

```
""
```

So when the problem says “delete the elements with zero-values,”
it literally means **remove empty strings**.

---

### ✅ **3. Slices and `append()`**

* Slices are dynamic arrays.
* `append(slice, value)` adds an element.
* If the capacity is full, Go automatically creates a bigger array and copies the elements over.

That’s why this works:

```go
result := []string{}
result = append(result, "a")
```

---

### ✅ **4. Range Loop**

The `for _, str := range original` loop:

* Iterates over each element in the slice
* `_` ignores the index
* `str` gets the value at each step

---

## 🧮 5️⃣ Visualization of Memory (Simplified)

Before the function:

```
main()
 ├── a → ["a", "", "b", "", "c", ""]
 └── calls Compact(&a)
```

Inside `Compact`:

```
ptr → points to a
original := *ptr → ["a", "", "b", "", "c", ""]
result := []string{} → []
```

After loop:

```
result = ["a", "b", "c"]
*ptr = result  // now a points to ["a", "b", "c"]
```

Back in `main()`, the slice `a` has changed.

---

## 🧠 6️⃣ Why Return `len(result)`?

Because it’s the number of *non-zero elements* remaining —
the function both **compacts** and **reports** the new size.

This saves the caller from having to write:

```go
len(a)
```

again after the function.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Concept      | What Happens                           |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Pointer      | Allows modifying the original slice    |
| `*ptr`       | Dereferences pointer to get the slice  |
| `append`     | Adds non-empty elements into new slice |
| Zero value   | Empty string `""` means “no data”      |
| Return value | Number of non-empty strings            |

---

### Final Code (for reference)

```go
package piscine

func Compact(ptr *[]string) int {
	original := *ptr
	result := []string{}

	for _, str := range original {
		if str != "" {
			result = append(result, str)
		}
	}

	*ptr = result
	return len(result)
}
```

Would you like me to show you a **version that does it in-place** (no second slice created) — the way you’d do it for maximum efficiency in real-world Go?
