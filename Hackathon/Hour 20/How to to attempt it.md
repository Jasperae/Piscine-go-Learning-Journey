Let‚Äôs walk through this step by step so you understand **why** the original code was broken and how the corrected version fixes it ‚Äî turning confusion into clarity.

## üß† Problem Summary

You're simulating a door system with functions to:
- Open and close a door
- Check if the door is open or closed
- Print status messages

The original code had:
- Missing return values
- Misused variables
- Incorrect function signatures
- Unclear logic

---

## ‚úÖ Fixed Version (with explanations)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Constants to represent door states
const (
	CLOSE = iota // 0
	OPEN         // 1
)

// Door struct with a State field
type Door struct {
	State int
}

// Prints "Door Opening..." and sets state to OPEN
func OpenDoor(ptrDoor *Door) {
	fmt.Println("Door Opening...")
	ptrDoor.State = OPEN
}

// Prints "Door Closing..." and sets state to CLOSE
func CloseDoor(ptrDoor *Door) {
	fmt.Println("Door Closing...")
	ptrDoor.State = CLOSE
}

// Prints status and returns true if door is OPEN
func IsDoorOpened(ptrDoor *Door) bool {
	fmt.Println("is the Door opened ?")
	return ptrDoor.State == OPEN
}

// Prints status and returns true if door is CLOSE
func IsDoorClosed(ptrDoor *Door) bool {
	fmt.Println("is the Door closed ?")
	return ptrDoor.State == CLOSE
}

// Main function to simulate door logic
func main() {
	var door Door // Create a Door instance

	OpenDoor(&door) // Open the door

	if IsDoorClosed(&door) {
		OpenDoor(&door) // Reopen if closed
	}

	if IsDoorOpened(&door) {
		CloseDoor(&door) // Close if open
	}

	if door.State == OPEN {
		CloseDoor(&door) // Final check to close
	}
}
```

## üîç Why Each Fix Was Needed

### 1. `state = CLOSE` ‚Üí ‚ùå
- `state` was undefined.
- ‚úÖ Fixed by using `ptrDoor.State = CLOSE`

### 2. `IsDoorOpen(Door Door)` ‚Üí ‚ùå
- Function didn‚Äôt return anything.
- ‚úÖ Fixed by returning a `bool` and renaming to `IsDoorOpened`

### 3. `IsDoorClose(...)` ‚Üí ‚ùå
- Missing return value.
- ‚úÖ Fixed by returning `bool` and renaming to `IsDoorClosed`

### 4. `main()` was inside `piscine` ‚Üí ‚ùå
- `main()` must be in `package main` to run as a program.
- ‚úÖ Fixed by changing package to `main`

## üß™ Example Output

```console
Door Opening...
is the Door closed ?
is the Door opened ?
Door Closing...
Door Closing...
```

## ‚úÖ Summary of Concepts

| Concept           | Why It Matters                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Pointers          | Needed to modify the original `Door` object  |
| Return values     | Required for condition checks (`if`)         |
| Constants         | Make state readable and maintainable         |
| Structs           | Encapsulate door state cleanly               |
| Package main      | Required for executable Go programs          |
