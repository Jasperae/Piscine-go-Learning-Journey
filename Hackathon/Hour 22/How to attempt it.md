Letâ€™s break this down and build a full understanding of the `RockAndRoll` function â€” not just memorize it, but learn how to design it from scratch with confidence.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem Summary

Youâ€™re asked to write a function that:
- Takes an integer `n`
- Returns a string based on whether `n` is divisible by 2, 3, both, or neither
- Handles negative numbers with a specific error message

---

## âœ… Final Code

```go
package piscine

func RockAndRoll(n int) string {
	if n < 0 {
		return "error: number is negative\n"
	}

	if n%2 == 0 && n%3 == 0 {
		return "rock and roll\n"
	}
	if n%2 == 0 {
		return "rock\n"
	}
	if n%3 == 0 {
		return "roll\n"
	}
	return "error: non divisible\n"
}
```

## ðŸ§© Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. **Function Signature**

```go
func RockAndRoll(n int) string
```

- Takes an `int` as input
- Returns a `string` as output

---

### 2. **Check for Negative Input**

```go
if n < 0 {
	return "error: number is negative\n"
}
```

- First condition handles invalid input
- Returns a clear error message

---

### 3. **Check for Divisibility by Both 2 and 3**

```go
if n%2 == 0 && n%3 == 0 {
	return "rock and roll\n"
}
```

- `%` is the modulo operator â€” it gives the remainder
- `n%2 == 0` means divisible by 2
- `n%3 == 0` means divisible by 3
- If both are true, return `"rock and roll"`

This condition must come **before** the individual checks to avoid returning `"rock"` or `"roll"` prematurely.

---

### 4. **Check for Divisibility by 2**

```go
if n%2 == 0 {
	return "rock\n"
}
```

- If divisible by 2 but not 3, return `"rock"`

---

### 5. **Check for Divisibility by 3**

```go
if n%3 == 0 {
	return "roll\n"
}
```

- If divisible by 3 but not 2, return `"roll"`

---

### 6. **Handle Non-Divisible Case**

```go
return "error: non divisible\n"
```

- If none of the above conditions are met, return a fallback error

## ðŸ§ª Example Runs

| Input | Output               |
|-------|----------------------|
| 4     | `"rock\n"`           |
| 9     | `"roll\n"`           |
| 6     | `"rock and roll\n"`  |
| -1    | `"error: number is negative\n"` |
| 7     | `"error: non divisible\n"` |

| Concept           | Why It Matters                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Modulo `%`        | Checks divisibility                          |
| Conditional order | Ensures correct logic flow                   |
| Error handling    | Covers edge cases like negatives and invalid input |
| Return strings    | Matches expected output format               |
