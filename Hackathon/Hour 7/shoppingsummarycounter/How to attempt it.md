Let’s go through the **theory and reasoning** behind this `ShoppingSummaryCounter` step-by-step — not just *what* it does, but *why* it does it this way.

---

## 🧠 Step 1 — What is the problem asking?

You are given a **string** like this:

```
"Burger Water Carrot Coffee Water Water Chips Carrot Carrot Burger Carrot Water"
```

and you need to know:

> How many times does each *item* appear?

For example:

* “Burger” → 2
* “Water” → 4
* “Carrot” → 4
* “Coffee” → 1
* “Chips” → 1

So, the result we want is a **summary** (a collection that pairs each item with a count).
In Go, that’s a **map**.

---

## 🧩 Step 2 — Understanding maps

A **map** in Go is like a dictionary:
It links *keys* to *values*.

### Example:

```go
m := map[string]int{
    "Apple":  3,
    "Banana": 5,
}
```

You can think of it like:

```
Apple → 3
Banana → 5
```

You can create an empty one like this:

```go
counts := make(map[string]int)
```

✅ This creates a map where each **key** is a string (the item name),
and each **value** is an int (the count of how many times it appears).

---

## ⚙️ Step 3 — Strategy (how to solve it)

We want to:

1. Go through each **character** in the string.
2. Detect when a **word** (item name) starts and ends.
3. Every time a word ends, **increase its count** in the map.

In other words:

> Split the string into words manually (without using `strings.Split`)
> and keep track of how many times each word appears.

---

## 🧮 Step 4 — Let’s break down the code

### Line 1:

```go
counts := make(map[string]int)
```

Creates our empty map that will hold the final result.

---

### Line 2–4:

```go
wordStarted := false
word := ""
```

These two help us track:

* whether we’re currently reading a word (`wordStarted`)
* and what the word currently is (`word`).

At the start, we haven’t read any word yet.

---

### The loop:

```go
for i := 0; i < len(str); i++ {
	char := str[i]
```

We loop through each **character** in the string one by one.

---

### Inside the loop

Now we check if the character is a space or not:

#### Case 1 — It’s **not a space**:

```go
if char != ' ' {
	word += string(char)
	wordStarted = true
}
```

✅ This means we’re still inside a word.
We keep adding the letters to `word`.
Example:

```
"Burger" → B → Bu → Bur → Burg → Burge → Burger
```

---

#### Case 2 — It **is a space**:

```go
else {
	if wordStarted {
		counts[word]++
		word = ""
		wordStarted = false
	}
}
```

This means a word just ended.
So:

1. We increase the count for that word in our map.

   ```go
   counts[word]++
   ```

   If it’s the first time the word appears, Go automatically starts it at 0, then adds 1.
2. Reset `word` to empty.
3. Set `wordStarted` to false because we’re now *between words*.

---

### After the loop ends

What if the string doesn’t end with a space?
Example: `"Burger Water"` — after `r`, we reach the end of the string.

In that case, the last word (`Water`) would never be added.
That’s why we do this check **after** the loop:

```go
if wordStarted {
	counts[word]++
}
```

✅ This makes sure the final word gets counted.

---

### Finally, we return the map:

```go
return counts
```

Now we have something like:

```go
map[string]int{
	"Burger": 2,
	"Water": 4,
	"Carrot": 4,
	"Coffee": 1,
	"Chips": 1,
}
```

---

## 🧠 Step 5 — Let’s trace an example together

Input:

```
"Burger Water Carrot"
```

| Step | Character | word              | Action        | Map result                             |
| ---- | --------- | ----------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | B         | "B"               | building word | {}                                     |
| 2    | u         | "Bu"              | building      | {}                                     |
| 3    | r         | "Bur"             | building      | {}                                     |
| 6    | (space)   | "Burger"          | add Burger    | {"Burger": 1}                          |
| 7    | W         | "W"               | new word      | {"Burger": 1}                          |
| ...  | ...       | ...               | ...           | ...                                    |
| 13   | (space)   | "Water"           | add Water     | {"Burger": 1, "Water": 1}              |
| ...  | ...       | ...               | ...           | ...                                    |
| end  | "Carrot"  | word still active | add Carrot    | {"Burger": 1, "Water": 1, "Carrot": 1} |

✅ Done.

## 🧩 Step 6 — Why not use `strings.Split`?

You **could** simplify this whole thing using:

```go
words := strings.Split(str, " ")
for _, word := range words {
    counts[word]++
}
```

But piscine projects usually **ban external packages like `strings`**, so this solution manually *builds its own split logic* — which teaches you:

* How to iterate over characters
* How to track word boundaries
* How to manage maps manually

This strengthens your understanding of *string parsing* and *maps*.

## ⚡ Step 7 — Key theory takeaways

| Concept                    | What it means                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **map[string]int**         | Stores key-value pairs (item name → count)          |
| **Loop through string**    | Lets us inspect each character manually             |
| **Build words manually**   | Detects item names using space as separator         |
| **`counts[word]++`**       | Increases count automatically (starts at 0)         |
| **Final check after loop** | Adds the last word if string doesn’t end with space |

## 💡 Analogy

Think of reading your shopping list aloud:

> "Burger Water Carrot Coffee..."

You have a notebook (the map).
Each time you finish saying a word (reach a space), you go back to your notebook and mark one more tick for that item.

At the end, your notebook shows how many of each thing you said.

That’s literally what your code does — but in Go.
