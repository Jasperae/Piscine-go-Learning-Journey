Absolutely! Let's break this down step by step so you understand **exactly** what’s happening and why — not just memorize it. This is a great exercise in mastering **pointer manipulation** in Go.

## 🧠 The Core Idea

The function `Enigma` takes four arguments — each a pointer with different levels of indirection — and **rearranges the values they point to** in a circular fashion:

- `a → c`
- `c → d`
- `d → b`
- `b → a`

This means:
- The value inside `a` gets moved into `c`
- The value inside `c` gets moved into `d`
- The value inside `d` gets moved into `b`
- The value inside `b` gets moved into `a`

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Understand the Pointer Levels

Let’s decode the types:

| Variable | Type         | Meaning                            |
|----------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| `a`      | `***int`     | Pointer to pointer to pointer to int |
| `b`      | `*int`       | Pointer to int                      |
| `c`      | `*******int` | 7-level pointer to int              |
| `d`      | `****int`    | 4-level pointer to int              |

To get the actual `int` value from each, you need to dereference the pointer the correct number of times:

- `***a` gives you the `int` value
- `*b` gives you the `int` value
- `*******c` gives you the `int` value
- `****d` gives you the `int` value

### 2. Save the Original Values

Before overwriting anything, we need to **store the original values** so we don’t lose them:

```go
tempa := ***a       // original value of a
tempb := *b         // original value of b
tempc := *******c   // original value of c
tempd := ****d      // original value of d
```

This is crucial because once you overwrite a value, you can’t get it back unless you saved it.

---

### 3. Perform the Value Swaps

Now we do the circular swap:

```go
***a = tempb        // b → a
*b = tempd          // d → b
*******c = tempa    // a → c
****d = tempc       // c → d
```

Let’s walk through what each line does:

- `***a = tempb`: Dereference `a` three times to reach the `int` value, and assign it the value from `b`.
- `*b = tempd`: Dereference `b` once to reach the `int`, and assign it the value from `d`.
- `*******c = tempa`: Dereference `c` seven times to reach the `int`, and assign it the value from `a`.
- `****d = tempc`: Dereference `d` four times to reach the `int`, and assign it the value from `c`.

---

## 🧪 Visualizing the Flow

Let’s say the values are:

- `***a = 5`
- `*b = 2`
- `*******c = 7`
- `****d = 6`

After the swap:

- `***a = 2` (from b)
- `*b = 6` (from d)
- `*******c = 5` (from a)
- `****d = 7` (from c)

---

## 🧩 Why Use Temporary Variables?

If you didn’t store the original values first, you’d overwrite them before they could be reused. For example:

```go
***a = *b       // b → a
*******c = ***a // now ***a is already changed!
```

This would be incorrect because `***a` no longer holds the original value of `a`.

---

## 🛠️ Summary of Concepts

- **Pointers**: Variables that hold memory addresses.
- **Dereferencing**: Accessing the value at the memory address.
- **Multiple levels**: You can have pointers to pointers (e.g., `***int`).
- **Safe swapping**: Always store original values before overwriting.
